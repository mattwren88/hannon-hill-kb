    "category": "_archive",
    "body": "Overview This tool is used to locate assets in Cascade Server dynamically. The returned assets are the Cascade CMS API objects. To be able to determine what properties the returned objects have, developers can use the PropertyTool. For ease of use, the Locator Tool can be accessed just by the &#8220;_&#8221; character. The following methods are available:\n\nlocatePage(path)\nlocatePage(path, siteName)\nlocateFile(path)\nlocateFile(path, siteName)\nlocateFolder(path)\nlocateFolder(path, siteName)\nlocateBlock(path)\nlocateBlock(path, siteName)\nlocateSymlink(path)\nlocateSymlink(path, siteName)\nlocateReference(path)\nlocateReference(path, siteName)\nlocate(path, type)\nlocate(path, type, siteName)\n\nParameter &#8220;path&#8221; should be the full path to asset being located, excluding site name. It can but does not have to contain a leading forward slash. Functions without &#8220;siteName&#8221; parameter will locate assets in the site where the Format is located. To locate assets in the site where the currently rendered Page is located, use $currentPageSiteName pre-populated variable. Functions with &#8220;type&#8221; parameter accept an EntityType object, which can be one of the following:\n\n\nTYPE_LINKABLE (includes pages, files and symlinks)\nTYPE_PAGE\nTYPE_FILE\nTYPE_FOLDER\nTYPE_BLOCK\nTYPE_TEMPLATE\nTYPE_REFERENCE\nTYPE_SYMLINK\nTYPE_FORMAT\n\nUsing any other type to locate an asset will result in an error.\nOne way of accessing the EntityType object is through the EntityIdentifier object, for example the following code will return Folder type: The following example code will output a list of faculty member names, assuming that Pages in current Folder have proper Data Definition assigned: Query Tool In addition to basic asset retrieval functionality, the Locator Tool also has the ability to search for assets based on a number of search criteria. The first step in using this api is to create a new query object like this: All executions of the query object require that either a Metadata Set or Content Type be specified on the query object itself. To do this, use one of the following two methods: The Metadata Set or Content Type is specified using the asset link format commonly used when linking between home area assets. Asset links begin with an optional site prefix (e.g. \"site://example.com\") followed by the path of the asset.\nNext, specify which asset types you would like to include in your results: All of these properties will be true by default, but are all listed here for completeness. Note that if you are matching by Content Type and not Metadata Set, only Pages will be returned.\nTo limit the results to only assets that have a particular value for one of their metadata fields, use the hasMetadata() method. A number of additional filtering options are available for your query including which can be supplied using the following methods:\n\nmaxResults(number of results) - Limit the query to a specified number of results. The default value is 100 while the maximum value for this filter is 500. Anything greater will be trimmed down to 500.\nsortBy(field name) - Results can be sorted by any one of the following properties:\n\nStatic Metadata Fields (\"author\", \"description\", \"displayName\", \"endDate\", \"keywords\", \"reviewDate\", \"startDate\", \"summary\", \"teaser\", \"title\")\nLast modified date (\"modified\")\nCreation date (\"created\")\nAsset name (\"name\")\nAsset path (\"path\")\n\n\nsortDirection(direction) - Results can be sorted in ascending (\"asc\") or descending (\"desc\") order\nsiteName(siteName) - Results can be limited to a particular Site using the Site's name\nsearchAcrossAllSites() - Results can come from all Sites\npublishableOnly(true/false) - Results can be filtered to only include those that are publishable\nindexableOnly(true/false) - Results can be filtered to only include those that are indexable. Note that when set to true, matched results must also have an empty start date or a start date in the past and an empty end date or an end date in the future. Once all required properties have been set and all desired filtering options have been specified, use the execute() method to retrieve your results. To see the current state of the query object itself, format writers can reference the query object variable. This will output a list of all the properties and their current values.\nQuery object reference: Output:",

    "title": "LDAP/Active Directory Authentication",
    "category": "Cascade Administration",
    "body": "Overview Your environment's LDAP Configuration interface can be found under Administration > Security and Authentication > LDAP Configuration. The LDAP Configuration interface consists of three main areas (tabs):\n\nOptions - general information regarding how Cascade CMS should connect to your existing LDAP/AD server.\nPolicies - an interface for building one or more user Policies. Policies specify which users you wish to sync/import into Cascade CMS and determine which Groups and Roles those users should inherit upon syncing.\nXML - an XML representation of your LDAP Configuration.\n\nNote: You must have at least one Policy set up in order to use the LDAP functionality within Cascade CMS. Options This screen contains general information regarding how Cascade CMS should connect to your existing LDAP/AD server. The fields located in this interface are self-documenting and for the most part self-explanatory; however, there are a couple of options here that are important to consider.\nOrphaned LDAP Users\nThe Orphaned LDAP Users option determines the action that Cascade CMS should take when an existing LDAP User in the system is no longer synchronized/imported with any of the existing Policies. The three possible actions are:\n\nIgnore - does nothing, no action will be taken for the User account.\nDeactivate - disables the User account. Disabled accounts can be manually re-enabled by an Administrator.\n\nNote: The Delete option has been deprecated to prevent accidentally mass deleting users during an erroneous LDAP sync and will be removed in a future release of Cascade CMS. Until the behavior is removed as a valid option, configurations with Delete/Remove will fall back to Deactivate.\nConsider the following scenario:\n\nAs part of an LDAP sync, a User named \"user1\" is imported into Cascade CMS and configured to authenticate against your LDAP/AD server any time they log into the system.\nSome time later, \"user1\" has their DN modified in the LDAP/AD server such that they no longer match any of the Policies that have been set up to sync.\nUpon the next LDAP sync (manual or scheduled), the system marks this User as orphaned because they are an LDAP User in the system but are no longer being synced with any of the current Policies.\nWhen this occurs, the User account in Cascade CMS will either be ignored or deactivated depending on the option selected for Orphaned LDAP Users.\n\nScheduling and Reporting\nIn addition to manually syncing with LDAP, the system can be configured to sync on a schedule. We typically recommend that this option be set to Repeat Every 1 days. If you need to sync more often than this, we don&#8217;t recommend doing so more frequently than once per hour since syncing large numbers of Users can be resource intensive.\nWhen running scheduled syncs, we also recommend using the Generate Report option to email a report to one or more system Administrators. This way, Administrators can be alerted to any potential syncing issues and see which users were added/removed during each sync. Policies In order to sync/import users from an LDAP/AD server, a minimum of one Policy must be configured in this interface, but you can add as many additional Policies as needed to manage your Users, Groups, and Roles.\nA Policy allows you to target specific subsets of users in your LDAP/AD server and import them into the system. This can be done either by pointing the configuration to one or more Container Identifiers (for type: User) or by specifying a Security Group Id (for type: Active Directory Security Group).\nUser Policy \nWhen creating a Policy of type User, Cascade CMS will attempt to iterate over the first level of users residing in the Container Identifiers that you&#8217;ve specified. It will not traverse sub-containers within a specified Container Identifier.\nThe Filter section allows you to filter on particular users within containers by specifying one or more Object Attribute Filter(s) (name/value pairs) or by using a Freeform Filter. The Freeform Filter field can be used to provide a filter using standard LDAP query syntax.\nActive Directory Security Group Policy\nUsing a Policy of type Active Directory Security Group allows you to point to the DN of a Security Group in your existing AD server. In addition to specifying the Security Group Id, you&#8217;ll also need to provide a Group Member Attribute Id. For this field, you&#8217;ll typically use a value of member as that is the attribute which specifies that a user is a member of the Security Group.\nAuthentication Mode\nThe Authentication Mode option specifies how the users synced/imported via your Policy will authenticate when logging into Cascade CMS. These options are:\n\nNormal - Use this option if you wish to import Users into Cascade CMS but not have them authenticate against your LDAP server. If selected, this option requires that you manually specify a password for each User that you&#8217;ve synced/imported into the system by editing each User account. Passwords for Normal Users are stored in the Cascade CMS database and are encrypted as well as salted and hashed.\nLDAP - This option should be selected if you want your users to authenticate directly against your LDAP/AD server each time they log in to Cascade CMS. In this scenario, no password information for those users will be stored in the Cascade CMS database.\nCustom - The Custom option is used to tell the application that the Users being synced/imported via your Policies will authenticate via your Single Sign-On (SSO) solution.\n\nNote: In order for Users to authenticate via your SSO solution, you must have your Cascade CMS environment properly configured to direct users to your organization&#8217;s SSO login page. See Custom Authentication for more information on integrating Cascade CMS with Single Sign-On solutions.\nTip: It's possible to configure a Policy to specify one authentication method while another Policy specifies a different authentication method. Example: Policy A can configure Users synced via Policy A to use Normal authentication while Policy B can configure Users in Policy B to authenticate via LDAP. XML The XML tab provides an XML representation of your LDAP Configuration, which is a combination of the information entered in both the Options and Policies areas. This can be useful if you&#8217;re copying a configuration from one environment to another (from development to production, for example) or if to maintain a backup of a working configuration.",

    "body": "Remove Content from the Global Area As of Cascade CMS Version 8, the Global area for content no longer exists. All content and components must be stored and managed in Sites. Before beginning the upgrade process, Cascade CMS will check to ensure that no content remains in the Global area or the Global area's recycle bin. If any content remains in either area the upgrade process will stop.\nBefore upgrading to Cascade CMS Version 8 please verify that the Global area is completely empty by taking the following steps:\n\nEnsure that there are no assets visible in the Global area's asset tree other than the base Folder or any base Administration area Container, except the Default Metadata Set. If any assets remain, they should be deleted as long as they are not being referenced by assets that are in Sites. Assets in the Global area referenced by assets in Sites must be migrated using the Site Migration Tool or manually by recreating the asset inside a Site and reassigning any assets that point to the old asset so that they point to the new asset. Note that Page assets without a Content Type migrated from the Global area into Sites must be assigned a Content Type before or after upgrading before they can be edited. (See Assign Content Types to Page Assets.)\nEnsure that there are no assets in the Global area's recycle bin. The recycle bin can be accessed from the Global area Dashboard or the Quick Links menu at the top right of the screen. If there are assets remaining in the Global area's Recycle Bin, you can use the Empty Recycle Bin link at the bottom of the recycle bin tab to remove them all at once.\nEnsure that there are no active workflows in the Global area, including \"Create\" workflows.\nOptional: Ensure that no assets in Sites use the Global area's Default Metadata Set. This can be verified by navigating to it in the Global area's Administration area and viewing the Relationships tab. Alternatively, any assets that still use the Global area's Default Metadata Set will be automatically updated to use a copy of the Default Metadata Set after the upgrade. (See Auto-Migrated Global Site.)\nOptional: Ensure that there are no \"Create\" drafts for any user in the Global area. To remove \"Create\" drafts for users other than yourself, assume the identity of those users, navigate to the Drafts tab on their respective Home area Dashboards, and bulk delete all remaining drafts. The ability to assume another user's identity is only available in version 7.14.x and above. Alternatively, any remaining \"Create\" drafts in the Global area will be automatically moved to the base Folder of the Auto-Migrated Global Site after the upgrade. (See Auto-Migrated Global Site.)\n\nIf you are a Cascade CMS Cloud customer, please follow the steps above and then contact support [at] hannonhill.com to coordinate a test of the upgrade.If you are using Cascade CMS on premise, please create a copy of the database and test upgrading the copy in a test environment. If the upgrade stops, the log file will list ids, paths, and types of all assets that must be updated, moved, or removed before the upgrade can complete. You should be able to access these assets (except for draft assets) directly by pasting the id and type included in each log message into the following URL:http://{cascade-domain.com}/entity/open.act?id={id}&type={type}Note that if you delete assets, the recycle bin should be emptied as a final step. Assign Content Types to Page Assets The elimination of the Global area in Cascade CMS version 8 means that Page assets must be managed in Sites and are therefore required to have a Content Type assigned to them.\nPages without an assigned Content Type may be migrated out of the Global area into a Site(s); however, upon upgrade they must be assigned a Content Type before changes to them can be submitted. It's recommended that this be done prior to the upgrade to avoid confusion on the part of content editors.\nThe following query will help identify any current version of a Page which does not have a Content Type assigned. Query Database to Verify Its Upgradability If you have access to the Cascade CMS database, you can run the following queries to ensure the system contains no problematic assets before attempting the upgrade.\nIf any of these queries return more than 0 rows, the database is not ready to be upgraded. These queries are read-only and can be be performed against a running Cascade Server 7 instance and database before attempting the Cascade CMS 8 installation. These queries should be run as many times as needed until they all return 0 results.\nSteps to resolve any issues that arise as a result of running these queries can be addressed using suggestions outlined in the Remove Content from the Global Area section. Auto-Migrated Global Site On upgrade, if certain problem assets associated with the Global area are detected:\n\nA new Site named \"_Auto-Migrated Global_\" will be created. This Site is not given any permissions or assigned any Users, so only Administrators or Users who have the \"Access All Sites\" ability enabled will be able to access it.\nAny assets that referenced the Global area's Default Metadata Set before the upgrade will be updated to use a copy of the Default Metadata Set (including dynamic fields) in the Auto-Migrated Global Site. The Relationships view can be used to re-assign these assets after upgrade.\nProblem assets detected will be moved into the base Folder of the Auto-Migrated Global Site and can be dealt with after upgrade. Rolling Back Cascade In the event that the Cascade CMS 8 startup check prevents you completing the upgrade and you are unable to login to the system, it is possible to run a special version of Cascade Server 7 against the same database. This allows you to address any startup errors without having to roll back the database itself.\nTo run a compatible version of Cascade Server 7 against a database that has been modified by Cascade CMS 8, use the following steps:\n\nDownload the Cascade Server 7.14.last ROOT.war file. Note that this version of Cascade Server 7 is only to be used when upgrading to Cascade CMS 8 and is not intended to be used in production.\nStop Cascade CMS 8 using cascade stop (Windows) or cascade.sh stop (Linux/OSX). Windows users who have installed Cascade as a service should stop the service.\nGo into your Cascade CMS 8 installation directory and copy the existing ROOT.war file that resides in the /tomcat/webapps directory and store it somewhere that will be easily accessible later but outside of the install directory (i.e. not in the /tomcat/webapps directory).\nDelete both the ROOT.war file and ROOT directory inside the /tomcat/webapps directory.\nTake the ROOT.war file that was downloaded in Step 1 and place it in the /tomcat/webapps directory.\nRun the following database query:\n\ndelete from DATABASECHANGELOG where ID = '8_0 migration';\n\n\nStart Cascade using cascade start (Windows) or cascade.sh start (Linux/OS X). Windows users running Cascade as a service should start the service.\nCascade Server 7 is now running against your existing database and you can address any startup errors that occurred when attempting the Cascade CMS 8 upgrade.\n\nOnce you have addressed all issues contained in the Cascade CMS 8 startup logs, you should re-run the queries in the Query Database to Verify Its Upgradability section to verify the system is ready for upgrade. Once complete, reinstall Cascade CMS 8.\n\nStop Cascade Server 7 using cascade stop (Windows) or cascade.sh stop (Linux/OSX). As mentioned in the initial steps, Windows users running Cascade as a service should stop the service.\nGo into your Cascade CMS 8 installation directory (now using the Cascade Server 7 ROOT.war file) and remove both the /tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war file and the /tomcat/webapps/ROOT directory.\nRetrieve the ROOT.war file that was created in Step 3 above, and move it into the /tomcat/webapps directory.\nStart Cascade 8 using cascade start (Windows) or cascade.sh start (Linux/OS X). Windows users running Cascade as a service should start the service.\n\nOnce the log file is clear of Cascade 8 startup errors, you will be able to log in to Cascade 8!",

If using FTP or FTPS, you would typically need to make exceptions for port 21 or 990 respectively.\nOnce the SFTP server has been configured as described above, you'll want to verify that you can connect to it from the application server (where Cascade CMS is installed).\nWe recommend using a 3rd party SFTP client (like WinSCP or Filezilla, for example) for this purpose as it will also allow for you to verify that connecting with the account places you in the expected directory on the web server's filesystem (the home directory of the SFTP account).\nAfter verifying that you can successfully connect using a 3rd party client:\n\nLog into Cascade CMS and switch into the Site you wish to publish\nCreate a new Transport using the SFTP account credentials that were verified above\nCreate a new Destination and when configuring it, select the Transport that was created in the step prior to this\n\nThe combination of the Transport and Destination are what determine how and where the CMS will publish. More information on that can be found in Determining Where Assets Will Be Published.\nTip: You can run general connectivity tests for both Transports and Destinations by clicking More -> Test Connectivity while viewing them. When testing Destinations, you can optionally choose to send 'dummy' files of 100kb or 1000kb in size. These tests can help to quickly determine if there is some sort of problem when the system attempts to connect using the information provided in the Transport/Destination (related to authentication or firewalls, for example).",

    "title": "Database Size Management Tips",
    "category": "Cascade Administration",
    "body": "Overview The overall size of your Cascade CMS database is dependent on a number of factors. Listed below are some of the more common culprits that can greatly affect the size of your database over time. Large file uploads Since everything managed in the CMS is stored in the database itself, it is fairly common for a large percentage of storage to be used up by file content. To get a better sense as to whether files may be requiring large amounts of your database storage, check out this article for Viewing the largest binary files in the database which will give you an overview all file assets in your instance.\nUltimately, if you find that there are some extremely large files that would best be handled externally (on a media server, for example), the query results will allow for you to track them down in the application and potentially remove them as needed. It is also possible to delete old versions of files from within the interface which can also help to free up storage. Default Max Upload setting The Default Max Upload setting is located within the Content Preferences. This setting controls the maximum size of files that users can upload into the application. Since everything managed in the CMS is stored in the database itself, it is important to consider what should be a good limit for file uploads based on how your organization uses the application.\nFor example, a reasonable setting might be around 20 megabytes for most organizations. This would allow for users to upload small media files (like hi-res images, videos and PDFs), but would prevent them from unknowingly (or knowingly) uploading file assets over 50+ megabytes in size.\nReducing the value for this setting will not retroactively affect any files that were uploaded prior to that modification. Max Asset Versions setting The Max Asset Versions setting is also located within the Content Preferences. This particular setting is important to consider especially in conjunction with the Default Max Upload setting described above. Consider an environment with the following settings:\n\nDefault Max Upload: 25000 KB\nMax Asset Versions: 50\n\nWith a max upload set to 25000 KB as seen above, a user is able to upload a file that is approximately 25 MB in size. This will immediately consume 25 MB of storage at the database level. \nNow we need to take into account what happens each time this particular file is edited. With any edit/submit of a File asset in the CMS, a version of that File is stored in the database in a version chain that is connected to the current version of the File. Therefore, any version of this File stored in the database will also require approximately 25 MB of additional storage. \nWith a Max Asset Versions setting of 50, users in the system could potentially end up editing this particular file up to 49 times before the system begins to trim older versions (to keep the version chain at a maximum of 50). Since each edit of this file stores roughly 25 MB of content for the resulting version, the end result is that what was originally a 25 MB file now requires 1,250 MB (or 1.25 GB!) in order to store all of the related versions. \nWe typically recommend that this particular setting be configured to somewhere between 20-30, although certain organizations may require that many more past versions be retained in the system. \nIf you plan on reducing the number of versions available for assets in your environment, be sure to see this article on the Max Asset Versions setting for details on how changing this affects existing version chains in the system. High numbers of read/unread messages Over time, users across the system tend to amass a lot of notifications (both messages that have been read along with messages that have gone unread). Many of these notifications come from automated tasks such as publish jobs and workflows, so it is easy for users to overlook ever discarding them manually.\nIt is possible to remove read, unread, and broadcast messages from the system by utilizing the option to Remove notifications and expired broadcast messages from within the Optimize Database tool. Depending on how large your cxml_mail table is to begin with, this operation can help to clear those items and potentially free up some additional storage space in your database.\nNOTE: We DO NOT recommend running any of the other tools listed in the Optimize Database area unless directed by Product Support as they will not have any noticeable impact on the size of the database. Database vendor configuration The scenarios and settings listed above are specific to Cascade CMS and how data is stored in the database. While the tips mentioned can potentially help to alleviate database storage issues (immediately or over time), keep in mind that there are settings specific to certain database vendors that can affect whether or not (and how much) space can be reclaimed after any of these steps are taken. Those settings are outside the scope of the application and should be handled by your organization's database administrator.",

You should see the following login screen.\n\nType the fully-qualified URL to your Cascade CMS instance into the first field. You will then type your username and password in the following fields. The Site Name dropdown will then populate with sites that are available in your Cascade CMS instance.\nChoose the site that you would like to migrate your content into and select Save and Next.\nYou will then be presented with the screen to choose content from your computer that you would like to migrate.\n \nClick on the Choose File button to choose a zip of the files that contain the content for migration. Once selected, click Save and Next.\nNote: If you have already utilized the Migration Tool, radio options will appear to work with previous batches of content.\n\nThe above screen will allow you to map where links for sections of content that are not being migrated should point. This is often helpful if you are migrating sections of content where you may be referencing the section using a relative link. If you are migrating all of your content in one migration, you can skip this screen by clicking Save and Next.\nIf you have relative links in your content being migrated to content not being migrated, you will need to decide whether that section of content should point to a Cross Site link or an External Link.\nUse Cross Site link if the content will be or has been migrated into another site in Cascade CMS.

It is alright to leave this field blank if no content should be converted to blocks.\nOnce you have entered your selections, select Save and Next.\n\nThe above screen will now allow you to map specific sections of content to specific fields in your page type in Cascade CMS. You should use XPath to target specific areas of content within your page source code. You can learn more about XPath by reviewing tutorials about XPath. XPath is not native to Cascade CMS.\nOnce you know your XPath, fill it into the text box below XPath. Then select the field you would like the content mapped to in the To Cascade Field dropdown. Select Add Mapping. Repeat this process as many times as necessary until all of your content areas are mapped.\nStatic values can also be mapped to Cascade CMS fields. Simply change XPath in the dropdown to Static Value. You will then fill in the content you would like mapped to the Cascade CMS field in the corresponding text field.\n\nThree common mappings are for title, keywords, and description in the head of an html page.\nThe following XPath can typically be used for those fields:\n\nKeywords: //meta[@name=\"keywords\"]/@content\nDescription: //meta[@name=\"description\"]/@content\nTitle: //title/text()\n\nTo map images to File chooser fields:\n\nTarget the element containing the src attribute that points to the image (do not target the src attribute directly)\nEnsure that the source files use relative image paths\n\nOnce all are mapped, select Save and Next.\nThe next screen will be the summary screen. The summary screen will present you with all of the information for what you selected to migrate. It will also have four different options for migrating content.\n\nKeep existing (adds numbers to the end of new asset names)\n\nThis option is typically used if you have not migrated content to the site yet. This is great for testing mappings because it will produce the fastest migration process. If you have already migrated content, you may not want to use this option since it will create duplicate pages for content already migrated.\n\n\nOverwrite existing (deletes and re-creates them)\n\nThis option is typically used for migrating content if you have already migrated into the site previously and you needed to refine mappings. This will do a delete and recreate each page in the migration set.\n\n\nUpdate existing (edits existing assets)\n\nThis option is typically used for migrating content if you have already migrated into the site previously and you needed to refine mappings. This will do an edit to the page in the migration set. Please note: all content in the page being remigrated will be updated, not just specific fields. This is advantageous in case you had created new content outside of this site that links to content being remigrated. It will prevent broken links in those cases.\n\n\nSkip existing (does nothing if asset already exists, always on for files)\n\nThis option is typically used for migrating content that was left out of the original migration. Two commn use cases are the following: 1) You forgot to include a directory of content in your migration set and you have now added it into the original set of content being migrated. 2)There was a common error on pages being migrated that prevented them from being migrated. You have now fixed that error in all of the files and would like to rerun the tool over the migration set.\n\n\n\nOnce you have reviewed your mappings and selected the appropriate radio option, select Save and Next to start the migration process.\nYou will now see all of your files and pages being imported into Cascade CMS.",

    "id": "cascade-administration-installation-and-upgrades-system-configuration-load-balancing",
    "title": "Load Balancing",
    "category": "Cascade Administration",
    "body": "Overview Load balancing is the process by which activity in the system is evenly distributed across a network (multiple application servers) so that no single device/server is overwhelmed. \nWith the re-architecture of Cascade CMS, users are provided the ability to load balance multiple application servers to reduce downtime and improve performance. This involves running multiple Cascade CMS machines behind a proxy, or load balancer; typically this will be Apache. To the end user, the CMS address stays the same; behind the scenes, one of many different application servers will handle each user&#8217;s requests.\nLoad balancing provides concurrency; it allows for more users in the system at one time. In addition, load balancing allows the system to handle server down-time more gracefully and includes failure detection. In the event of a server failure, for example, with three Cascade CMS servers running and Apache &#8220;in-front&#8221; of it handling load balancing, Apache will simply stop sending requests to the failing server.\nPlease note, when using Load Balancing, it is recommended that you have all of your servers living on the same LAN.\n \nThis diagram illustrates a typical CS load balanced network topology. Requests from end users are received by an Apache instance running the mod_jk module. These requests are then dispatched by mod_jk to the CS machines. The CS servers interact with the database normally. Typically one will be able to run multiple CS servers against a single database. Sometimes, depending on the configuration, it may be desirable for the database to also be load balanced; this is currently outside the scope of this document. At present, only CS load balancing is supported by Hannon Hill. Load Balancing Requirements All CS machines must be running the exact same version of the software.\nRunning multiple CS nodes on the same physical machine is not supported.\nWhen upgrading a group of CS servers, all nodes must be brought down before the software is upgraded on each node.\nHannon Hill supports using Apache 2+ mod_jk for fail-over and load balancing.\nEach CS node name must be unique.\n\nIf you have CS deployed in something other than the ROOT webapp, you will need to ensure that your JkMount directive uses the same webapp name as the mount point.\nSession replication will not be a part of the CS load balancing strategy. That means that any user sessions that are on a node will be terminated if that node is brought down. The user will see this event as being redirected to the login screen.\nWhen running in a load balanced configuration, all servers on which Cascade CMS are running must have their internal clocks synchronized to within one second of each other. The preferred solution is to use a common NTP (Network Time Protocol) server setting on all application servers.\nAll servers in a load balanced configuration must have their search index location (Administration > Search Indexing > Index Location) set to a shared disk space. Tomcat Configuration Each CS application server runs off of an included Tomcat 8 instance. In order to enable load balancing, edit the conf/server.xml file:\nAdd a jvmRoute=&#8221;nodename&#8221; attribute to the <Engine.../> element: The name of each node must be unique across all CS servers. Apache Configuration The supported load balancing configuration includes Apache 2 + mod_jk. This document assumes that Apache 2 will load mod_jk as a shared module. This document also assumes that the reader has some familiarity with configuring Apache.\nOnce Apache 2 and mod_jk have been built, ensure that the following configuration file changes are made: The JkMount directive assumes that the sole purpose of this apache instance is to proxy to a group of CS machines. If this is not the case, one may provide these directives in the context of a virtual host.\nNote also that depending on how Apache is launched on your system, it may be necessary to provide full paths to the shared memory file, log file, and workers file. The workers.properties file is the configuration file that mod_jk uses to determine where to relay requests. We&#8217;ll go over each one of the lines in this configuration: This defines the load balancer worker. It will distribute requests to each CS server. Defines a worker called xpproone. This must be the same name as that node&#8217;s jvmRoute attribute in server.xml. This worker is available at 192.168.168.128. Note that the port should be the same across all instances. This worker has a load factor of 1. Higher load factors will get more requests from mod_jk. Similarly defines a worker called xpprotwo. The semantics in the previous section also apply here. Defines the loadbalancer worker to be special type of worker that can distribute requests to other workers. Configures that worker to distribute its requests to xpproone and xpprotwo. Cache Configuration In order for caching in load balanced Cascade CMS nodes to work properly, please follow these steps:\n\nOn each node, locate the ehcache.properties file in the directory: tomcat/conf.\nOpen the file in a text editor.\nVerify whether or not your network has &#8220;multicast&#8221; enabled. If so, replace the replication=none property with replication=multicast in Section 1. If you are unsure if multicast is enabled, you can try it out with default settings and then confirm that cache synchronization works using the steps below. If you are aware of your specific multicast settings being different than the default ones, you will need to update the properties in Section 3.\nIf multicast is disabled, replace the replication=none property with replication=manual in Section 1 and proceed to Section 4 where you will need to provide current node's IP address in thisnodeaddress property and IP addresses of all the nodes in node{n}address properties where {n} is a consecutive number you can assign to each node starting from 1. It is important not to skip a number (e.g. by providing node1address and node3address but skipping node2address).\nOptionally, you can change the port number the nodes will use to communicate with each other in Section 2. Change this if the default port 40001 is already taken by some other application. Change the async property to false if your nodes take too long time to synchronize with each other causing data inconsistency issues.\nCopy the configuration to each node. For manual replication please remember to update thisnodeaddress property for each node.\n\nImportant - In addition to the rmiport setting in the ehcache.properties file (default: 40001), the cache synchronization process must be able to dynamically allocate ports between 1024 - 65536 on every node in the cluster. Firewalls must be configured to allow all traffic between nodes over this entire port range.\nImportant - These steps will need to be repeated after each upgrade of Cascade CMS from this point forward. Verifying Cache Synchronization With nobody else accessing Cascade CMS at the time of this test, please perform the following steps:\n\nVerify that Index Block Rendering Cache is enabled in the Administration > Preferences > Content > Index Blocks and that the Use legacy caching strategy option is disabled.\nLog in to one node of your choice directly and create a folder Index Block with a folder selected so that at least one child asset&#8217;s name is being rendered in that Index Block when viewing it. Do not include the assets&#8217; XML contents in your Index Block.\nView that Index Block and take note of the child asset&#8217;s name inside of the rendering.\nLog in to another node and rename that child asset.\nLog back in to the first node and refresh the Index Block rendering. Verify that the new name is being displayed now.\n\nIf you still see the old name, it means that cache synchronization is not working properly. Potential reasons:\n\nYour firewall does not allow your nodes to communicate with each other. Please verify that the port provided in Section 2 as rmiport is open for communication between the nodes. Alternatively, change that port number to something else.\nIf your configuration uses multicast replication you might need to adjust the multicast properties in Section 3. If you are unsure if multicast is enabled in your network at this point you might be better off by configuring manual replication.\nIf you are using manual replication, please make sure that all the nodes&#8217; IP addresses are correct, nodes numbers in property names are in consecutive order and that the thisnodeaddress property value is updated for each node.\nIf you can verify your cache synchronization works using the steps above but it does not work using some other steps (especially if these steps involve making many asset modifications in short period of time), you can try disabling the async option is Section 2 which will end up with slower execution but it will make sure that all your nodes are synchronized as soon as changes are being made instead of performing the synchronization in the background. Tying it Together Once configuration files have been edited, start Apache, and each Tomcat node. After the servers have been brought up, users should be able to access Cascade CMS through Apache. Troubleshooting I try to log in, but keep getting redirected to the login screen over and over.\nThis is usually a result of a misconfiguration with mod_jk. Make sure that each node&#8217;s jvmRoute attribute is set correctly, and is the name of the worker as defined in worker.properties.\nI can log in, but I get automatically logged out repeatedly.\nThis is a common result of having asynchronized internal clocks on multiple servers. When running in a load balanced configuration, all servers on which Cascade CMS are running must have their internal clocks synchronized to within one second of each other. The preferred solution is to use a common NTP (Network Time Protocol) server setting on all application servers.",

Each user in the system must be given membership in at least one group, and can be given membership in multiple groups. Group role membership is passed on to the user, meaning that the user is assigned any roles that are assigned to the group(s) that the user belongs to. This is a convenient and often preferred way to easily change role memberships across groups of users.\nGroups are created and populated by administrators or via a third-party authorization system (e.g. LDAP authentication). Because a group is made up of one or more users with common permissions, placing multiple users into groups is a great way to customize permissions settings. If your organization is a university, for example, as an administrator it's your job to identify groups of users who should all have similar access rights and permissions based on your content contribution and management scheme. Let&#8217;s say you have 40 professors using Cascade CMS only for managing course catalogs. These users should more than likely be placed in the same group.

    "title": "Roles",
    "category": "Cascade Administration",
    "body": "Overview A role is a set of a abilities that governs a user's access to a number of different areas in Cascade CMS. They can be assigned to a user directly, to any of the user's groups, or to a site to which the user requires access. Roles are not to be confused with Access Rights which control read and write access to specific assets.\nThere are two types of roles in the system: System Roles and Site Roles. These two role types have many abilities in common, but they apply within different contexts. System Roles are applicable in the Administration Area and cannot be assigned to sites. Site Roles, as you may have guessed, are applicable to sites. Site Roles, however, do not control access to tools and areas of the system that are not specific to a particular site. For example, access to the Sites menu is governed by a user's System Role because the Sites menu can be accessed from anywhere in the system and is not specific to any particular site.\nYou can access the Roles menu by clicking the system menu button ( ) > Administration > Roles. The following information will be displayed for all roles:\n\nName\nType - You can filter roles by their type (System or Site) using the filter button.\n\nClick on any role in the list to view its:\n\nAbilities - A list of role abilities and whether they are enabled or disabled for this role.\nUsers - A list of users to which the role is assigned either directly or through one or more of their groups. For Site Roles, a list of sites in which the user is assigned the role either directly or through one of their groups will be provided.\nGroups - A list of groups to which the role is assigned. For Site Roles, a list of sites in which the group is assigned the role will be provided.\nSites (for Site Roles) - A list of sites to which the role is assigned.\n\nAdditional options are available in the More menu while viewing a role:\n\nRelationships - A list of assets to which the role is linked. For System Roles, this will be users and groups to which the role is directly assigned. For Site Roles, this will be sites to which the role is assigned.\nAudits - A summary of activities performed in the system by all users who are assigned this role.\nAccess - The read/write permissions for the role asset itself.\nDelete Effective Roles In order to figure out whether or not a user has access to an area in the system, Cascade CMS must first determine the user's effective role which includes all of that user's abilities across all of his or her roles in a particular context. The context being either a Site or a System area.\nA user's effective System Role is determined by taking all of the roles assigned to the user's groups and all of the roles assigned to the user directly and \"summing\" them. For example, if a user is assigned a contributor role and the user's group is assigned a manager role, then the user effectively has all of the abilities in the contributor role as well as all of the abilities in the manager role when in the System area.\nA user's effective Site Role is determined a little differently, because Site Roles are assigned to sites directly. The effective Site Role is also only applicable when in a particular Site. Nevertheless, the same principle of summing the abilities for all of a user's Site Roles still applies (including those roles that are assigned to the user's groups).\nBe aware that while in a site, System Roles will still apply for abilities not contained in Site Roles. As mentioned earlier, access to the publish queue is controlled by System Roles; therefore, a user's effective System Role still applies for this ability when inside a Site.\nTo see what effective abilities a user has in a particular Site, click More > Effective Abilities while viewing a user and select a site from the drop-down menu. Adding a Role To add a role to the system:\n\nClick the system menu button ( ) > Administration > Roles and click Add Role.\nChoose System or Site role.\nAll role abilities for a new role are disabled by default. Enable the abilities you want users assigned this role to inherit by clicking the checkbox next to the applicable role. You can also select a role to use as a template for the new role from the Based on original role drop-down.\nClick Submit. Assigning System Roles To assign a System Role to a User or Group:\n\nClick the system menu button ( ) > Administration > Users or Groups.\nSelect the user or group and click Edit.\nIn the Membership and Roles tab, click Choose Roles and select one or more System Roles to assign to the user or group. Any System Roles that have already been assigned to the user or group will be checked. Click Choose, and notice that the newly assigned roles are now displayed in the Membership and Roles tab.\nClick Submit.

For example, if a user is created with the username \"person123\", that user must log in by typing their username \"person123\" and not \"Person123\".\nNote: It is not possible to modify the Username for a User after their account has been created.\nPassword Policies\nUsers of authentication type Normal must have passwords that meet the following policies:\n\nAt least 12 characters when using alphanumeric, or 8 characters if using special characters\nCan not include 4 consecutive characters from username, full name, or organization name (i.e. System Name)\nCan not include 4 consecutive numbers or letters (e.g. \"defg\", \"3456\", etc.)\nCan not include 3 consecutive characters that are the same (e.g. \"aaa\", \"111\", etc.)\nShould not contain common weak passwords Checking a User's Effective Abilities The Effective Abilities tool allows administrators to get an overview of the abilities a user will inherit for a specific site based on their Site Role.

Assuming a User's Identity Users with the Assume another User's identity ability enabled in their System Role can assume the identity of any other user. This tool can be used not only to get a quick visual representation of what a user sees but also what they can access in different sites.\nTo assume another user's identity, either select the user from the user list and click the Assume this user's identity button at the top of the list or click More > Assume Identity while viewing a user.\n\nAfter assuming a user&#8217;s identity, you'll see exactly what that user will see when they're logged into the system.

System The options within the System tab allow you to customize basic system-wide preferences.\nGeneral\n\nSystem Name - This name appears on the login screen and at the bottom of the system menu flyout panel.\nSystem URL - The address used when accessing the system; this is required for links in email notifications sent by the system.\nSystem Label Color - This option configures the color of the top menu bar in the interface and can be used to distinguish production instances from test or development instances, for example.\n\nSSL/TLS Key Store\n\nKey Store Path - Specifies the location of the SSL key store on the application server.\nKey Store Password - Specifies the password to the key store on the application server.\n\nNote: changes to either Key Store preference requires a restart of the application in order for the changes to take effect.\nOther\n\nSession Timeout - The duration (in minutes) that a user's session can remain inactive before being automatically logged out by the system. \n\nAny value less than 0 will be interpreted as 60 minutes.\nIf a user logs out manually their session will be ended.\n\n\nLicense Expiration Notification - The number of days ahead of the instance's licence expiration date that an expiration warning message should appear in the interface. Email Email options allow configuration of an SMTP server to send email for certain system-generated notifications including LDAP synchronization notifications and Task assignment notifications.\n\nSMTP Host - SMTP server hostname or IP address.\nSMTP Port - SMTP server port.\nSecure SMTP - Enable to use secure SMTP.\nSMTP Username - Username to authenticate against the SMTP server.\nSMTP Password - Password to authenticate with the specified username against the SMTP server.\nSMTP From Address - The email address the system will send emails from.\nMax Wait Time - The maximum duration (in seconds) to wait before attempting to send the next batch of emails. Use this to minimize frequency of emails sent to the SMTP server.\nMax Queued Emails - The maximum number of emails to be queued before system will empty the queue. Use this to minimize frequency of emails sent to the SMTP server.\nEmail Test - Test the email settings by sending a test message to the address specified.\n\nNote: Workflow notifications, Daily Content Reports, and Review Date notifications are sent via a built-in email service and those emails will come from noreply@cascadecms.com. Content Content options provide more detailed customization for how the system handles various types of content.\nGeneral\n\nMaximum File Upload Size - Determines the maximum size for any uploaded files, including file assets and site imports.\n\nThis can be used to restrict the upload of large images and video files, for example, and can be restricted further at the Asset Factory level with a plugin for more specific size limitations.\nThis value is limited by the database, which is based on the maximum BLOB size allowed (max_packet_size and 10% of innodb_log_file_size for MySQL). The maximum value allowed is 512MB (524288KB) to help prevent system instability.\nSite imports via file upload and uploading zip files for unpacking are not restricted to this preference, instead, they are limited to 2GB based on browser limitations.\n\n\nContent Checks - Configure the default content checks that will be run when assets are submitted if the site has Inherit from system preferences selected in its Site Settings.\n\nAssets\n\nAppearance of Asset Links - Determines whether assets are displayed by their Title / Display Name or their system name for users who have not already saved this preference in their user settings.\nMax Asset Versions - Determines the maximum number of versions that will be stored for any given asset. Once the maximum number of versions is reached, the oldest version is removed.\nEditable Text File Extensions - Determines the types of text files that are editable in the system's code editor.\nEditable Image File Extensions - Determines the types of image files that are editable in the system's image editor.\nExpiration Warning - Determines how soon in advance of an asset's expiration a user will be notified via an internal notification.\n\nAsset Naming Rules\n\nAsset Naming Rules - Asset naming rules configured at the system level will be enforced for Sites which have the Inherit from system preferences selected in its Site Settings. Note that changes to asset naming rules are not retroactive and will apply only to new assets.\n\nIndex Blocks\n\nMax Assets in Index Blocks - Determines the maximum number of assets that may be returned by an index block.\nMaximum Rendered Size of an Index Block - This preference puts a cap on the amount of content that can be generated by an index block before an error is generated and the block rendering is aborted.\n\nUsing this preference will help prevent OutOfMemory errors that can occur when index blocks get too large.\n\n\n\nNote: We recommend keeping this setting under 15MB if at all possible. Values larger than this may cause Index Blocks to grow to sizes which can result in performance degradation. The maximum value allowed is 40MB.\n\nIndex Block Rendering Cache\n\nEnabled - If the rendering of an index block is not being refreshed (the cache isn't being discarded) or you've changed the Maximum Rendered Size of an Index Block setting, you can clear the rendering cache by disabling this option, selecting Submit, and immediately reenabling it after the cache is cleared.\nUse legacy caching strategy - In some limited cases, improvements to caching in later versions of Cascade CMS will cause problems for index blocks that were incorrectly showing less assets in 6.10 and earlier. You can enable a legacy caching strategy which will cause the system to render and cache assets as it did in versions prior to 7 meaning that asset content is not cached between asset renderings. This option is only meant to allow instances with this issue to continue to operate while the problem is investigated; it should not be used as a long term fix - instead the index block implementations should be corrected.\n\n\n\nFeed Blocks\n\nRequest Timeout - The amount of time to allow before the system times out when requesting a particular Feed Block. The default timeout is 10 seconds with a maximum allowed value of 20 seconds.\n\nPublishing\n\nSmart Publishing - If this option is enabled, files that haven't been modified in the system since the last publish to a specific Destination won't be republished. Also, files which have been altered or removed on the destination server will be republished. This feature applies only to files larger than 10MB that do not have Rewrite links in file enabled.\nReport relative links as broken when publishing - Determines whether relative links are reported or ignored upon publishing.\nPublish Job Timeout - The duration (in milliseconds) before the system times out the transmission of a particular asset when publishing.\n\nOther\n\nXSLT Formats\n\nEnable Xalan JavaScript extensions - Controls whether Xalan JavaScript extensions can be used when transforming pages with XSLT Formats.\nEnable Xalan Java extensions - Controls whether Xalan Java extensions can be used when transforming pages with XSLT Formats.\nIn most cases, you will want to disable Java extensions because they allow users to run arbitrary Java code inside the system which poses a large security risk. JavaScript extensions can be used to write utility functions for date formatting and other things that are difficult to do in XSLT alone. EXSLT extensions are not affected by either of these preferences as they are a set of known functionality that cannot be used in a malicious fashion. If an implementation is not using Xalan extensions, these options should be disabled to minimize the security risk. Reports Link Checker Configuration\n\nRun Scheduled Link Checker - Enable and configure this option to scan links in content at regular intervals and populate the Broken Links Report.\n\nOnly links in sites that have Scheduled Link Checker enabled in their Site Settings will be checked.\nDepending on the amount of links to be checked, this can be a resource-intensive process. To avoid impacting system performance for users or scheduled publish jobs, we recommend configuring the link check to run on a weekly basis, during off-peak hours.\n\n\n\nDaily Content Report\n\nSend Daily Content Report to Subscribers - Enable and configure this option to generate the Daily Content Report for users who are subscribed to receive it.\nRun at - Determines when the Daily Content Report should be sent Integrations & Plugins Siteimprove Settings\n\nEnable Siteimprove Plugin - Enabling this option will provide access to your Siteimprove data within the Cascade CMS interface. After logging in, the plugin will overlay quality assurance, analytics, and accessibility data when viewing relevant pages.\nDo not include \"index\" in Siteimprove URLs - Enable this option if the index pages for your site appear as https://www.example.com/about/ in Siteimprove as opposed to https://www.example.com/about/index.html.\n\nDigital Asset Management\n\nWiden Collective API Key - Provide your Widen Collective API key to enable Widen integration for your system.\nWebdam Domain - Provide your organization's Webdam domain to enable Webdam integration for your system.",

If you want to temporarily pull your content off your server (maybe for maintenance or time-sensitive reasons) with the possibility of adding it back later, you'll want to unpublish your content.\nOn the other hand, if you want to remove content from Cascade CMS altogether, use the delete function. Deleting content will unpublish it (with an option to confirm if previously published) and move it to the Trash bin, where it will remain for an administrator-designated amount of time before being purged from the CMS.\nDeleted content can be recalled from the Trash as long as the user has access to see it and as long as it has not been purged. Preventing Publishing Additionally, you'll be able to prevent content from being published using a publishing preference. For example, if you have a page in development but not quite ready for \"prime time\", it can be hidden from Cascade CMS publishing hooks.\nTo keep content from being published, locate the Configure tab while editing an asset. The Configure tab will show checkboxes for indexing (\"Include when indexing\") and publishing (\"Include when publishing\"). Disable the \"Include when publishing\" option and click Submit. Note: doing so will essentially \"freeze\" any content you already have on your webserver, so you may want to unpublish your content before disabling publishing for the asset in question.\nDisabling \"Include when indexing\" will prevent Cascade CMS from indexing the asset (or its contents if the asset is a folder) internally.

This means this plug-in can work with JPEG, JPEG2000, BMP, PNG, and GIF images. Parameters Number of additional images - The number of images the plug-in will create in addition to the original.\nImage widths/heights - A comma-delimited list of widths/heights for the additional images. Example: 450,20%\n\nTo use a pixel value, simply enter the number of pixels.\nTo use a percentage, enter the percentage followed by the percent sign.\nA blank space character could be used as well as one of the values. This will cause the plug-in to calculate the width/height of the resized image so that the original aspect ratio is kept. Leaving both width and height values blank for the same image is not allowed.\n\n\n\nBoth the width and height comma-delimited lists must be specified and must contain an amount of comma-delimited values equal to the number of additional images. Examples The following parameters will create one additional image that is 15% of the size of the original image. For example: If the original image is 1000x1000 pixels, the plug-in will create an additional 150x150-pixel copy.\n\nNumber of Additional Images: 1\nWidths: 15%\nHeight: 15%\n\nThe following parameters will create one additional image that is 200 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall. Note that because the width and height are both specified, the aspect ratio of the original image won't be maintained.\n\nNumber of Additional Images: 1\nWidths: 200\nHeight: 100\n\nThe following parameters will create one additional image that is 150 pixels tall, and the image's width will be calculated so that the original aspect ratio is maintained.

The first image will be 150 pixels wide, and the image's height will be calculated so that the original aspect ratio is maintained. The second image will be 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall, and the original aspect ratio will not be maintained.\n\nNumber of Additional Images: 2\nWidths: 150,300\nHeight: ,200\n\nThe following parameters will create two additional images, one 150 pixels tall and one 300 pixels tall, and the images' widths will be calculated so that the original aspect ratio is maintained.\n\nNumber of Additional Images: 2\nWidths: ,\nHeight: 150,300\n\nNote - When using this plug-in, if you specify that a workflow should not be used, the plug-in will bypass any create workflow in place for the placement folder, regardless of whether the user has the rights to do so or not.",

Your JRE should match (or be backwards compatible) with the version of Java required by your version of Cascade CMS.\nCollecting the tools\nBefore you get started, Cascade 7+ users should download the following:\n\nEclipse IDE\nAsset Factory Plugin SDK\n\nIf you wish to use a different IDE to write your plug-in, you can develop against the standalone assetfactory-plugin-{VERSION}.jar and the cascade-api-{VERSION}.jar files that come in the SDK.\nInstalling Eclipse and Opening the SDK\nOnce you download Eclipse you will want to unzip it to a directory of your choosing. Suggestions:\n\nC:\\java\\eclipse or C:\\Program Files\\Eclipse on Windows\n/usr/local/eclipse on Linux\n&#126;/java/eclipse on OS X\n\nStart Eclipse and you will be prompted to choose a workspace location - the default location should suffice. Make note of it as this is where we will unzip the SDK to. Next, you will unzip the Plugin SDK to your workspace directory. The zip should create its own directory inside your workspace directory.\nFinally, we will bring in the Plugin SDK (which is really just an Eclipse project) into Eclipse. To do this:\n\nRight-click in the package explorer view on the left-hand side and select \"Import...\".\nThen, select \"Existing Projects into Workspace\" under \"General\" and click \"Next\".\nSelect \"Browse\" next to \"Select root directory:\" and browse to the directory created when you unzipped the SDK. You should then see \"Asset Factory Plugin\" under \"Projects\".\nClick \"Finish\".\n\nYou should now see the project in your Package Explorer. The project has two packages:\n\nThe resources package - this is where your \"resource bundles\" will live. A \"resource bundle\" is a set of localized strings describing various aspects of your Asset Factory plugin, such as the name, description, and the names and descriptions of any parameters your Asset Factory plugin may utilize. Note that the name of this package must be \"resources\" and must live off the root of the project.\nThe \"com.mycompany.cascade.plugin\" package - this package can be renamed to whatever you desire - this is where your Plugin class will reside.\n\nWriting the Plugin Class\nA plug-in is a Java class that implements the AssetFactoryPlugin interface. It is strongly recommended that you extend the BaseAssetFactoryPlugin class because it contains the implementation of helper methods that the framework relies on.\nThe plug-in writer will need to implement the following methods:\npublic void doPluginActionPre(AssetFactory, FolderContainedAsset)\nThis method is called before the user has performed the initial edit. The FolderContainedAsset passed as a parameter will contain the data from the asset factory's default asset, if one is set. At this stage, the asset has not yet been created.\npublic void doPluginActionPost(AssetFactory, FolderContainedAsset)\nThis method is called after the user has performed the initial edit. The FolderContainedAsset passed as a parameter will contain the data from the asset factory's default asset, if one is set. At this stage, the asset has not yet been created.\npublic void setAllowCreation(boolean flag, String reason)\nThis method allows plugin authors to allow/disallow creation of a new asset from an AssetFactory based on logic they describe. Calling this method with the parameter false will prevent the asset from being created and display the given reason to the user as an error message.\npublic Map<String, String> getAvailableParameterDescriptions()\nThis method shall return a map where the keys are the names of the parameters (keys into the resource bundle) and the values are the descriptions of the parameters (keys into the resource bundle). This method must return a non-null Map object.\npublic String[] getAvailableParameterNames()\nThis method returns a non-null array of strings which are keys into the resource bundle, each of which is the name of a parameter this plug-in can take.\npublic String getDescription() \nThis method returns a key into the resource bundle which is the description of the plug-in.\npublic String getName()\nThis method returns a key into the resource bundle which is the name of the plug-in. \nWhat is a \"key into the resource bundle\"?\nThe resource bundle is a file that allows internationalization of your plug-in. This file is formatted with key/value pairs, one on each line. The key is generally a dotted string (example: \"name.of.my.plugin\") and the value is a human-readable string (example: \"This is the name of my plug-in\"). The key/value pairs are separated by an equals (\"=\") sign. You can find two sample resource bundles in the Asset Factory Plug-in SDK.\nDisallowing asset creation\nA powerful aspect of Asset Factory plug-ins is their ability to determine which assets are allowed to be created and which aren't. By default, assets are always allowed to be created. However, if a plug-in writer deems that due to some conditions an asset is not to be created, that plug-in writer can throw a new FatalPluginException that contains the reason why the asset cannot be created. The plug-in writer can also call the function setAllowCreation() with the first boolean parameter set to false and the second String parameter explaining why the asset was not allowed to be created. The framework will then check this and pass the specified message up to the user.\nNote: By default, a plug-in is set to allow assets to be created, so if your plug-in is not intended to restrict creation, you will not need to add any additional code.\nExceptions\nAsset Factory Plug-ins may use two types of exceptions: a PluginException or a FatalPluginException. A PluginException is a general exception that will NOT stop other plug-ins from executing, but it will halt the execution of the current plug-in. A FatalPluginException stops other plugins from executing AND tells the plug-in framework to not allow the asset to be finalized and put into the system.\nWhat to do with your plug-in\nFirst, create a JAR file containing your plug-in file and the resource bundle(s) it references. To do this:\n\nRight click on your project in the Package Explorer (left hand side) in Eclipse and select \"Export...\".\nUnder the \"Java\" section, select JAR file and click \"Next\".\nNext you will be prompted as to which files to include. Ensure the checkboxes for your plug-in package and resources package are selected. If you click on your project, you will see that the \".classpath\" and \".project\" files are included, which are unnecessary and should be unchecked so they are not included in the JAR. The rest of the default options should be fine (only things checked are \"Export generated class files and resources\" and \"Compress the contents of the JAR file\").\nUnder \"Select the export destination:\", select where the JAR file will be temporarily placed before deployment to Cascade CMS.\nClick Finish.\n\nTo deploy the plug-in JAR:\n\nFirst you must shut down Cascade CMS.\nNext, locate the JAR file and place this file in <Tomcat_Installation_Location>/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib under the Tomcat Deployment directory. JAR files placed in this location are automatically loaded along with other libraries needed by Cascade CMS.\nOnce you have done this, start Cascade CMS and go to the Asset Factory section in the Administration area and select Manage Plugins.\nIn the \"Add a Plugin\" text field, enter the fully qualified Java class name of your plug-in (for instance, \"com.mycompany.cascade.MyPlugin\") and click Submit. The plug-in will then be added and will be accessible in the \"Plug-ins\" tab when editing an Asset Factory.\n\nWhat can go wrong\nIf you loaded your plug-in and now you can't edit any of your Asset Factories (blank screen), the most likely cause is Cascade CMS is being told to look for a key which does not exist in the resource bundle you have supplied. If you can examine the logs, you will more than likely see a message about \"Could not locate key for this.is.the.missing.key\". You will need to ensure that all the keys that you return in your getAvailableParameterDescriptions(), getAvailableParameterNames(), getDescription(), and getName() functions point to valid keys in your resource bundle for all locales.\nOther Resources\nThe Asset Factory Plugins Github project is another great resource for developing your own custom Asset Factory Plugins.",

    "title": "Index Blocks",
    "category": "Content Authoring",
    "body": "Overview An index block is a special type of block that returns a listing of assets from the CMS directory structure in the form of XML data. Assets like pages, files, folders, external links, and even other blocks can be returned as XML content. An index block can even return the data content of multiple pages within a directory for use on other pages within the system.\nIndex blocks may also be used to return a listing of all pages of a particular content type. For example, all news articles found in a particular site may be lumped into a \"news articles\" index block.\nIn Cascade CMS, index blocks are typically used for creating dynamic navigation menus, site maps, indices, etc.\nBecause index blocks can be configured to index an entire site or a specific folder, the way you configure index blocks in your system will vary depending on your needs and specifications. You can choose to create index blocks that are limited by either the number of assets in a given folder, or by the number/depth of folders to index. To ensure dynamic and consistent content across your site, any time content relevant to that index block in the system changes (a page is added, deleted, renamed, moved, etc.), the index block automatically updates, and all pages using the index block are also updated. Creating an Index Block To create an index block:\n\nClick Add Content > Default > Block.\nSelect Index and click Choose.\nIn the Name field, enter a name for your block.\nIn the Placement Folder field, choose the folder where the block should be created.\nUnder Index Block Settings, configure the following options:\n\nFolder Index - Choosing this option will generate block contents based on the contents of the specified folder. If you want the block to index nested folders, simply select the highest folder.\n\nRendering Behavior - This field has a great deal of impact on the structure of the rendered XML. It is important to choose a type of rendering behavior that is best suited to the purpose of a particular index block.\n\nRender normally, starting at the indexed folder - This is the most common option and allows one to preview the rendered block XML in most cases when viewing the index block itself. This option renders data starting at the \"Index Folder\", and renders its children forward at a depth specified in the \"Depth of Index\" field. Subfolders will be included in the render, along with their children, to the extent to which the depth of index will allow.\nStart at the current page and include its folder hierarchy - One may think of this as a backwards render. This rendering option depends on a current page context. That is, that this option requires that the index block be rendered in a region of a page (it is for this reason that you may not see XML in the \"view\" of an index block asset in Cascade CMS). The rendering will start at the current page, render it, and then proceed to render each parent folder until the base folder is rendered. These index blocks tend to be rather small, and are well-suited for breadcrumb navigation generation.\nStart at the current page with folder hierarchy, and also include siblings - This option is like the \"Start at the current page and include its folder hierarchy\" option, except that for each parent folder asset rendered, it will also render that folder's children as well. For example, when rendering with his option, the renderer will start at the current page and render all of the siblings of that page, including the page itself. It will then render the parent folder and all of its siblings, repeating until the base folder is rendered. Note that this option will not continue to render sibling folders as the parent folder hierarchy is traversed.\nStart at the current page with folder hierarchy, siblings, and also render forward - This option expands on the \"Start at the current page with folder hierarchy, and also include siblings\" rendering option, but also includes rendering the siblings of the current page, exactly the same way that the normal rendering option would render the current page's parent folder. This option is in effect, a combination of the \"Render normally, starting at the indexed folder\" and the \"Start at the current page with folder hierarchy, and also include siblings\" options.\n\n\nDepth of Index - If you only want one folder indexed, type in 1. If there are nested (or child) folders that you wish to include, type in the number of levels you want. If you are indexing all levels, but aren't sure how many there are, it is ok to overshoot (i.e. 100).\n\n\nContent Type Index - Choosing this option will generate block contents based on pages that share the specified Content Type.\nMax Rendered Assets - Determine how many assets you wish to be rendered. Limiting this number is useful when you want to return only the most recent pages, for example.\nIndexed Asset Content - This allows you to determine what information is included in results. These results may be styled or filtered via an accompanying script format.\n\nAppend Calling Page Data - Appends data from the page which includes this index block.\nRegular Content - Includes content visible to users when editing.\nSystem Metadata - Includes system information such as when the asset was created and last updated, and by whom.\nUser Metadata - Includes metadata the user can change.\nTags - Includes tags assigned to the asset.\nFolder Access Rights - Includes permission information such as user and group names and their level of access.\nUser Information - Includes information about the current user.\nWorkflow Information - Includes the asset's workflow information, if applicable.\n\n\nIndexed Asset Types - This allows you to limit the types of assets. For most navigation features, only pages and links need to be indexed.\nPage XML - This field controls how page XML is rendered inline during an index block render.

Examples of Index Block XML The examples below show a portion of an index block for each of the four types of indexed assets: folder, page, file, and external link.All index blocks begin with the following XML document element: In this example, index-block is the system name of the block asset, and the index block is a folder index block. The current-time attribute is the Cascade CMS server's local time at which the index block was rendered represented as a Unix timestamp in milliseconds.A Content Type index block would start with the following: Note that Content Type index blocks do not display folder structure using <system-folder> elements. They inherently only contain <system-page> elements, because Content Types can only be assigned to pages.The following sections demonstrate index block XML for a page without a Data Definition, a page with a Data Definition, a folder containing a single page, a file, and an external link, an index or feed block, and an XHTML, XML, or text block.\nPage without a Data Definition Page with a Data Definition Folder File External Link Index or Feed Block XHTML, XML, or Text Block",

Text blocks are not as widely used as their XHTML counterpart is, because text blocks lack the standard WYSIWYG editor contained inside of XHTML blocks that allow for the creation of rich content with images, links, and standard text formatting options.\nMore often an XHTML block will be the desired solution; however, there are appropriate times to make use of a text block instead of an XHTML block. For example, where an administrator desires the user to enter plain text only, without any formatting or images. In this case, a text block is the appropriate solution for the content region. The administrator can then style the text block with a format. Like all blocks, a text block may be attached to a template, Configuration Set, or page, and may be reused across multiple pages.

Spell Check The Spell Check checks and reports all words (in asset content and metadata) that are not found in the system dictionary.\nDepending on your role abilities, you have the following options for handling each misspelled word:\n\nAdd - Add the word to the system dictionary.\nIgnore - Disregard the word.\nFix - Enter your own correction or choose from a list of suggested replacements.\n\nNote - Only users with the Modify Dictionary ability enabled in their System Role can add words to the system dictionary. Link Check The Link Check ensures that all links between assets in the system and links to external resources are valid. The Broken Link column lists the URL of the broken link, and the Link Text column lists the text wrapped for hyperlinks or the tag name for other types of links. You can click the question mark icon ( ) to the left of each link for more information on why the link is considered invalid.\nYou have two options for handling each broken link:\n\nIgnore - Disregard the link.\nFix - Enter a corrected URL in a text box (for external links) or choose an asset within Cascade CMS via an asset chooser (for internal links).\n\nScheme-relative Link Checking\nExternal links that do not include a protocol, such as \"//google.com\" rather than \"http://google.com\" or \"https://google.com\" are called scheme-relative links. On the live site, they will navigate the website visitor to the same protocol as the page they are on. Cascade CMS follows a slightly different checking routine for such links as it cannot predict which protocol the visitor is going to view the page on. It verifies the link works with any of the two protocols and reports the link as broken only if the connection fails for both of these protocols. Accessibility Check The Accessibility content check ensures WYSIWYG content complies with the following accessibility guidelines:\n\nImage (img) tags must have alternate text describing the graphic. (Section 508 / WCAG 2.0)\nTable captions should not be empty.

    "body": "Overview Cascade CMS provides a number of different ways to manage links in content depending on the type of asset containing the link, the type of link (internal or external), and the location of both assets. Asset links Asset links or internal links are links between assets, such as Pages or Files, managed within the same Cascade CMS environment.\nSame-site links\nSame-site links are links to an asset within the same site as the current asset. Example same-site link paths:\n/path/to/page\n\n<img src=\"/path/to/file.png\"/>\nCross-site links\nCross-site links are paths to an asset located in a different site than the current asset. They begin with a site:// prefix followed by the name of the site where the linked-to asset is located. Example cross-site link paths:\nsite://Site Name/path/to/page\n<a href=\"site://Site Name/path/to/page\">Link</a>\nIn order for a cross-site link to resolve correctly, the linked-to asset must be found at the site and path provided and must be published.\nNote - Internal links to page assets should not include the page's file extension, because this is added during publish depending on the page's Configuration settings.\nLink tracking\nMost internal asset links are tracked, meaning the CMS creates an id-based relationship between the two assets and the link's path will be automatically updated if the linked-to asset is moved or renamed. (See \"Asset links in XML-based content\" below for more information.)\nIn contrast, external links, fully-qualified links to assets outside of the CMS including the file extension, are not tracked. Example external link:\nhttps://www.example.com/path/to/page.html\nWhile it's also possible to create an \"external\" link to a CMS-managed asset, it will not be tracked and won't be updated if that asset is moved or renamed.\nNote - In some scenarios, an asset link that would normally be tracked in the system fails to be tracked. To correct these untracked links, a background task runs once per day to realign internal links within recognized XML-based content. Asset links in XML-based content Certain attributes of some elements in XML-based assets are automatically checked by Cascade CMS for asset links. Those XML-based assets are:\n\nPages\nTemplates\nXML Blocks\nXHTML Blocks\nXSLT Formats\n\nThe table below describes which elements and attributes are automatically checked for links to CMS-managed content when editing, creating, or rendering the content.\nElements and attributes managed as tracked links\n\n\nElement\nhref\nsrc\nbackground\n\n\n\n\na\nYes\nNo\nNo\n\n\narea\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nbody\nNo\nYes\nYes\n\n\ntd\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\ntable\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\nembed\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nframe\nNo\nYes\nNo\n\n\niframe\nNo\nYes\nNo\n\n\nimg\nNo\nYes\nNo\n\n\ninput\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nparam\nYes\nYes\nYes\n\n\nlink\nYes\nYes\nNo\n\n\nscript\nNo\nYes\nNo System-asset pseudo-tags To create asset links in non-XML content or outside of a recognized attribute (see \"Asset links in XML-based content\" above), you can use system-asset pseudo-tags to mark the path as a CMS-managed asset.\n[system-asset]/path/to/asset[/system-asset]\nScenarios where you may require system-asset pseudo-tags include:\n\nbackground images in CSS\nimported CSS files\nimages referenced in JavaScript rollover code (either in JavaScript files or in page content)\n\nExample using system-asset pseudo-tags with a path for a CSS background image:\nbody {\n background: url('[system-asset]/_files/images/background.png[/system-asset]')\n}\nNote - To ensure asset links within a file are tracked and rewritten correctly, ensure that the Rewrite asset links in file option is enabled in its Configure tab.\nLocal asset pseudo-tags\n[system-asset:local]/path/to/asset[/system-asset:local]\nUsed to create a link to the asset at the path provided in whichever site the current page is located.\nFor example, consider a Template shared by many sites, each with their own custom CSS file. You can use system-asset:local pseudo-tags in the Template to tell the CMS to include the CSS file specific to the site where the current page is located.\n<link href=\"[system-asset:local]_files/css/main.css[/system-asset:local]\"/>\nThis type of link doesn't point to a specific asset; so while the link will be rewritten during preview and when published, it's not tracked or link-checked.\nEmbedded image pseudo-tags\n[system-asset:embedded-image]/path[/system-asset:embedded-image]\n\nUsed for embedding images in PDF and RTF file formats. By supplying a path to the tag, the CMS is able to pass the appropriate image to the FO processor so that it can display in the resulting document.\nOutput pseudo-tags and attribute\n[system-asset:configuration=output_name]/path/to/page[/system-asset:configuration]\n\nUsed to create a link to a different Output of the page specified.\n<a system-page-output=\"pdf\">Printer-friendly Version</a>\n\nUsed to create a link to a different Output of the current page. When published, the system-page-output attribute is replaced by an href attribute. Linking to a page rendering Within Cascade CMS by default a link to another page is rewritten such that clicking on that link will display the page asset preview inside the Cascade CMS. In some cases, though, it's necessary to link to the actual rendering of the page itself and not the page asset. This is useful, for example, when the linked-to page generates pure JavaScript content and we want to link to that page from inside of a script tag's src attribute. Along these same lines, its possible to link to a page that generates pure CSS using a link tag with an href attribute that references the CSS file.\nTo be able to link to the actual rendering, the parameter raw needs to be included in the link, for example:\n<link href=\"/css/page-that-renders-css?raw\"/>\n\nUsing this parameter affects only renderings inside of Cascade CMS. It does not have an effect on published pages because the raw parameter is stripped during publishing:\n<link href=\"../css/page-that-renders-css.css\"/>\nThe above example will generate a link to the default Output for the Page. If you need to generate a link to a different Output's rendering, use:\n<link href=\"[system-asset:configuration=configuration_name]/css/page-that-renders-css?raw[/system-asset:configuration]\"/> Links between pages and page outputs Pages often publish to multiple locations with multiple Output extensions by using Configurations with more than one page Output. Links within the page content that link to other pages will be rewritten differently upon publish depending on which page Output they're being rewritten for and which Output the target page has.\nThe following table shows three different pages, using different Configurations.\nPages with different Configurations\n\n\nPage\nContent Type\nConfiguration\nOutput\n\n\nPageA\nCT1\nCS1\nHTML (Default)\n\n\nPageB\nXML\n\n\nPageC\nCT2\nCS2\nASP (Default)\n\n\nXML\n\n\n\nWhen a page links to another page, it tries to link to the same output. When PageA links to PageB inside the default output (HTML), then the link will direct to the HTML output. If PageA is linking to PageB in the XML output, the link will direct to the XML output. The pages stay in the same outputs unless specified (using [system-asset:configuration=HTML] for example).\nLinking between PageA or PageB to PageC, which has different outputs, works a little differently. Since PageC does not have an HTML output, when PageA/PageB link to PageC in the HTML output, the link directs to the default output of PageC (ASP). There is no need to specify that PageA's HTML output needs to link to PageC's ASP output.\nLinking from the XML output in PageA/PageB to PageC will stay in the XML output, since they are both named XML. Link Rewriting Using Destination URLs Once a page is published, links in that page to other assets managed in Cascade in the same site are rewritten using a relative link format, by default. Cross-site links are rewritten as absolute links by prepending the linked-to site's URL property. It's possible to link from one Output that publishes to one web server to a different Output that publishes to another web server, while both reside in the same site in the CMS.\nMobile Output Example\nFor example, when linking from an HTML Output that publishes to http://example.com, to a Mobile Output that publishes to http://m.example.com, the Mobile Destination URL will be used.\nHere is a complete list of requirements for a Destination URL to be used when link rewriting:\n\nLink points to a different Output, either using a [system-asset:configuration] tag or simply linking to a page that has a different default Output.\nThe linked-to Output publishes only to selected Destinations, which is specified at Content Type level.\nOut of the selected Destinations, only one distinct Web URL property is specified; two or more Destinations can have a Web URL specified, but they must be identical.\nThe page that is currently being published that contains the link is not currently being published to a Destination with the Web URL.\n\nTherefore, going back to the example above, the following setting would produce a link that uses Destination URL upon publish:\n\nPage /pageA, HTML Output links to /pageB's Mobile Output using [system-asset:configuration=mobile]/pageB[/system-asset:configuration].\nPage /pageA's HTML Output publishes to Destination HTML, while /pageB's Mobile output publishes only to Destination Mobile - both configured at Content Type level.\nDestination Mobile has a URL set to http://m.example.com. Destination Standard has a URL set to http://example.com.\nThe resulting link upon publish would look like this: http://m.example.com/pageB.html and it would be linked from a page located at: http://example.com/pageA.html.\n\nOverriding the Site URL for Cross-Site Links\nThe Destination's Web URL, when specified, also overrides the Site's URL when cross-site linking to a page Output that is set to publish to a particular Destination via it's Content Type. In this case, the site's URL is ignored and the Destination Web URL is used instead.",

You can see how long it takes for each region in a page to render and can then adjust blocks and formats applied to slow regions to improve rendering times.\nTo view rendering metrics for a page, click More > Rendering Metrics.\nTotal Rendering Time is the overall time (in milliseconds) that it took to render the page.\nAny regions where rendering time is greater than 250ms are considered \"slow\" and appear in the Slow Regions section. Each region can be expanded to show the block and format assigned to the region and how long it took to render the block and apply the format.\nIndex Block metrics include the number of assets rendered and if the maximum number of indexed assets is reached. The asset count does not include assets rendered for Index Blocks that are rendered inside pages whose XML is rendered as a part of the original Index Block rendering. So, an Index Block that only indexes 1 page, where that 1 page contains an Index Block that indexes other pages, will only be displayed as having rendered a single asset as a part of the Index Block rendering.\nThe next section is All Regions, which displays every region in the page and how long it took to render each. Each region can be expanded the same way as the Slow Regions section.\nThe last section is Other Rendering Operations, which includes Supporting Asset Load Time, Link Rewriting Time and Serialization Time. Generally, you won't be able to do anything to change these numbers, but they could be a cause for concern if there are unreasonably high values reported.\nNote - Note that the sum of the individual rendering times will not always add up to the total rendering time. This is because there are some system operations related to rendering that are not displayed as a part of rendering metrics and should be thought of as overhead rendering costs. Troubleshooting Slow Region Renders Slow loading page regions are usually the result of slow loading Index Blocks associated with those regions. When troubleshooting a slow loading Index Block, consider the following:\n\nHow many assets is the Index Block rendering?\nCould the depth or location of the index be changed to limit the number of assets being rendered?\nCould you use a Content Type Index Block instead of a Folder Index Block to index only pages using a particular Content Type?\nIndexing both asset content and metadata is more time consuming. Does your index block need to index asset content? Many dynamic content regions only require the metadata of other assets.",

Other region names can be used to create as many additional content regions as necessary. If no region exists when the Template is created or edited, a DEFAULT region will automatically be added immediately after the opening <body> tag.\nNote - Renaming a system region will cause any Block/Format assignments to be removed from that region.

    "body": "Overview Destinations define the link between site content and the location to which site content can be published. Destinations allow for publishing content on a schedule, and specifies encoding (UTF-8 or ASCII) for the published content. A Destination is associated with a single transport that defines the protocol and location of a remote server to use when publishing content out of the system. In other words, whereas a destination defines the link between a site and transport, a transport represents the physical location of a server which can be used for any number of sites. Creating a Destination To create a Destination:\n\nNavigate to Manage Site > Destinations and click Add.\nFrom here you can either create a Container to group related Destinations or a Destination.\nConfigure the following fields in the General tab:\n\nName - How the system identifies the Destination.\nParent Container - The main storage folder for the Destination.\nEnable destination - Allows users to temporarily deactivate certain Destinations. For example, downtime or a content freeze could merit temporarily disabling a Destination.\nDirectory - Generally, this value is inherited from the Transport.\n\nIf the directory field is empty, the Transport directory will be used to determine where content is published.\nIf the directory contains an absolute path, the Transport directory will not be used. The Destination directory will be used as the exact path where content is published.\nIf the directory contains a folder name, then the folder supplied in that field is appended to the end of the Transport directory where content will then be published. For example, if the Transport Directory points to the \"test/main\" folder on the server and \"new/destination\" is filled into the Destination Directory field, content will be published to the \"test/main/new/destination\" folder.\n\n\nTransport - Selects the Transport upon which the Destination will be based.\nApplicable Groups - Determines which groups may publish to the Destination. Unless a group is defined here, this Destination will not show up on an asset's list of available Destinations on the publish screen for that group.\nWeb URL - A base URL used for linking to specific Configuration Outputs. For more information see \"Link Rewriting Using Destination URLs\".\nExtensions to Strip - A comma-separated list of extensions (such as .html, .php). Links pointing to assets published to this Destination will have these extensions stripped.\n\nTo strip extensions from cross-site links pointing to assets in the current site, add the same extensions to the Extensions to Strip field in Site Settings.\nThe web server will need to be configured to map the extensionless links to the appropriate files (for example, with an .htaccess file).\n\n\nPublish to this Destination by default - If this Destination is optional and should not be used every time an asset is published, the checkbox should be unchecked. This way users would need to manually select that Destination when sending an asset to the publish queue.\nPublish ASCII characters instead of Unicode - Cascade CMS publishes content in Unicode by default; this may be overridden by selecting the ASCII checkbox.\n\n\nIn the Scheduled Publishing tab, content can be set to publish automatically on a schedule.\nClick Submit to save the new Destination. Testing Destination Connectivity The Destination test utility allows users to test Destination connectivity without invoking a publish. To run a Destination test:\n\nNavigate to Manage Site > Destinations.\nSelect the Destination you wish to test.\nClick More > Test Connectivity.\nOptionally: Select the number of files and size of files to test.\nClick Start Test.

Or you may want to publish your site's homepage when you create a news item, so that the homepage news feed pulls in the new story.\nCascade CMS offers a couple ways to achieve this:\n\nPublishable Relationships - When publishing, selecting the View and Publish Related Content option prompts you to view the asset's Relationships and opt to publish them. Relationships are created automatically when assets link to each other in their content, but can also be manually created to establish relationships between assets that aren't directly linked.\nContent Type Publish Sets - The Include Publish Set option allows you publish the Publish Set associated with the page&#8217;s Content Type. Associating a Publish Set with a Content Type is a great way to ensure that related content is published when new pages of that page type are created and published. Publishable Relationships Relationships are assets that are related, either directly or manually, to another asset. For example, Pages or Blocks that link to the page you're viewing will be listed as Relationships for that page.\nPublishable Relationships are related assets that can be published: Folders, Pages, and Files.\nYou can view an asset's relationships by selecting More > Relationships.\n\nFrom this menu you can select publishable assets from the list to publish or click Publish All to publish all publishable relationships.\nIf related content doesn't directly link to your asset, you can also manually associate Folders, Pages, or Files with an asset:\n\nClick More > Relationships.\nUnder Create a manual relationship click Choose Publishable Site Content.\nSelect a folder, page, or file asset and click Choose.\nClick Close when you've finished adding or removing relationships.\n\nNote - Only manually-added relationships can be removed from the Relationships menu. To remove a linked relationship, you must edit the related asset directly to remove the link.\nTip - Ensure that related assets are published along with an asset in workflow by adding a publish-related-assets parameter to your Publish trigger. Content Type Publish Sets If you have content you'd like to publish each time a new page of a given type is published, such as publishing a blog landing page or RSS feed whenever a new blog page is published, you can achieve this by associating a Publish Set with the appropriate Content Type.\nTo add a Publish Set to a Content Type:\n\nNavigate to the Content Type and click Edit > Publish Options.\nUnder Publish Set, click Choose Publish Set.\nSelect the appropriate Publish Set and click Choose.\nClick Submit.\n\nNote - If you would like contributors to be able to publish Content Type Publish Sets along with a page, ensure they have the following Site Role abilities enabled:\n\nAccess the Manage Site area\nAccess Publish Sets\nPublish readable Administration area assets\n\nas well as read access to the Publish Set itself.\nTip - Ensure that the associated Publish Set is published along with an asset in workflow by adding a publish-related-publishset parameter to the Publish trigger in your Workflow Definition.",

    "body": "Overview A Transport represents a server to which content can be published. Transports can be used by one or more Destinations. Destinations provide an extra layer of abstraction on top of Transports that allow users to publish content to different locations on the same Transport. Basically, a Transport is \"how\" the content gets there and Destination is \"where\" it goes. Filesystem Transports Filesystem Transports can push out content to a location on the CMS server&#8217;s hard drive or to a mapped network location. In order to successfully publish using a Transport that points to a mapped network location, the operating system level user executing the Cascade CMS system process must have the appropriate privileges to write to and create new files in the network publish location.\nNote - Filesystem Transports are applicable to legacy on-premise environments only.\nTo create a Filesystem Transport:\n\nNavigate to Manage Site > Transports.\nNavigate to the container in which the new Transport will be stored, or create a new container using Add > Container.\nClick Add > Transport.\nSelect Filesystem and click Choose.\nIn the Name field, enter the name for your Transport.\nIn the Parent Container field, select a container for the Transport, if desired.\nIn the Server Directory field, enter a directory path. This path will be prepended to an optional non-absolute Destination Directory path when determining the full published path of an asset. This combined path is then prepended to asset paths when publishing. For example, if a Transport has a Server Directory of '/www/publish root', the Destination using the Transport has a Directory of 'mysite' and the asset being published has a system path of '/content/my press release'; then the asset will be published to the '/www/publish root/mysite/content' directory in the filesystem. If, however, the Destination being used contains an absolute path, then the Server Directory field on the Transport will be ignored.\nClick Submit.\n\nFilesystem Access Rights and Permissions\nFilesystem Transports are restricted by filesystem level access rights and permissions. In order to successfully publish, the user who owns the Cascade CMS process must have write access to the directory specified in the Transport. Otherwise, the publish report will contain access rights violations.\nMapped Network Locations\nIt is possible to publish to a mapped network drive using a Filesystem Transport. The directory used as the mount point for a network-mapped drive should be treated like any other directory in the filesystem. Note, however, that because Cascade CMS is treating the drive like a directory; the mechanism by which the drive is being shared (NFS, FTP, etc.) cannot be managed by Cascade CMS. An alternative would be to set up an FTP/FTPS/SFTP server and a corresponding FTP/FTPS/SFTP Transport that can be managed from within Cascade CMS. FTP/FTPS/SFTP Transports FTP/FTPS/SFTP Transports push content to a remote server via the FTP, FTPS (FTP over SSL/TLS), or SFTP (Secure FTP) protocols. The account specified in the Transport's settings must have appropriate privileges on the remote server to navigate through the folder structure, write, and create to ensure that publish operations do not encounter errors.\nTo create a FTP/FTPS/SFTP Transport:\n\nNavigate to Manage Site > Transports.\nNavigate to the container in which the new Transport will be stored, or create a new container using Add > Container.\nClick Add > Transport.\nSelect FTP/FTPS/SFTP and click Choose.\nIn the Name field, enter a name for your Transport.\nIn the Parent Container field, select a container for the Transport, if desired.\nUnder Transport Settings, configure the following fields:\n\nServer Name - The hostname of the server to which Cascade will connect.\nServer Port - The port over which Cascade will communicate with the FTP/FTPS/SFTP server. Note that the default port for each protocol selected below is preselected.\nServer Directory - An optional directory path that is prepended to a non-absolute Destination Directory path when determining the full published path of an asset. This combined path is then prepended to asset paths when publishing. For example, if a Transport has a Server Directory of '/www/publish root', the Destination using the Transport has a Directory of 'mysite' and the asset being published has a system path of '/content/my press release'; then the asset will be published to the '/www/publish root/mysite/content' directory on the FTP/FTPS/SFTP server. If, however, the Destination being used contains an absolute path, then the Server Directory field on the Transport will be ignored.\n\n\nUnder Protocol, select one the following:\n\nFTP - With option to Use Passive FTP (PASV).\nFTPS - FTP over SSL/TLS.\nSFTP - Secure FTP.\n\n\nUnder Authentication Settings, configure the following fields:\n\nUsername - The username used when authenticating with the FTP/FTPS/SFTP server.\nAuthentication Type\n\nPassword - The password to be used in combination with Username to authenticate with the FTP/FTPS/SFTP server.\nSSH Key - Allows you to upload a Private Key file and an optional Private Key Passphrase to authenticate with an SFTP server.\n\n\n\n\nClick Submit. Database Publishing Database publishing allows publishable assets (pages, files, and folders) to be published to an external MySQL database. This gives developers of third-party applications a way to access the content in Cascade CMS in a structured, tabular format. Database publishing requires a Database Transport and a Destination that uses the Transport. Content published to this Destination will end up as records in the remote database.\nTo create a Database Transport:\n\nNavigate to Manage Site > Transports.\nNavigate to the container in which the new Transport will be stored, or create a new container using Add > Container.\nClick Add > Transport.\nSelect Database and click Choose.\nIn the Name field, enter the name for your Transport.\nIn the Parent Container field, select a container for the Transport, if desired.\nUnder Database Transport Settings, configure the following fields:\n\nSite Id - An identifier that is attached to each item published using this Transport that is used to differentiate between publishes from different Database Transports.\nServer Name - The hostname of the server to which Cascade will connect.\nServer Port - The port over which Cascade will communicate with MySQL.\nDatabase Name - The name of the database into which data will be inserted.\nUsername - The username used when authenticating with MySQL.\nPassword - The password to be used in combination with Username to authenticate with MySQL.\n\n\nClick Submit.\n\nRequirements for Database Publishing\n\nDatabase publishing requires MySQL 5+.\nThe default character set on the external database and all its tables and text columns must be set to utf8, and the collation must be utf8_unicode_ci.\n\nNote - SSL is not currently supported for Database Transports. Because MySQL 8 defaults to SSL for connections, if you are using MySQL 8 on your target database, you may need to add ssl=0 to the target database's configuration file and restart it to disable SSL entirely.\nTypes of Content being Published\n\nFiles - Published files include the name, location, path, and metadata of the associated asset in the CMS; the published version, however, does not include the byte content of the file.\nFolders - Published folders include the name, location, path, and metadata of the associated asset in the CMS; they serve as containers for collections of other files, pages, and folders.\nPages - Published pages include the name, location, path, and metadata of the associated asset in the CMS; also includes the rendered content of the DEFAULT region (i.e. page specific content with any default region transformations applied). Works with both Structured Data and WYSIWYG Pages.\n\nExternal Database\nDatabase publishing creates records in an external database that containing five tables: file, folder, page, metadata, and metadata_custom. The file, folder and page tables contain records that are mapped from the corresponding assets managed in Cascade. The metadata and custom_metadata tables contain the wired and dynamic metadata for the page, file and folder assets represented in the file, folder, and page tables. A few notes on some of the above fields:\n\naccount_id - should always be 1\nsite_id - is an arbitrary value that reflects a particular site to which the record belongs, and is set on the transport\nfolder_id - corresponds to the cms&#173;&#173;_id of a folder, and not its id field in the remote database\n\nThe default database schema for database publishing can be downloaded here.\nSite IDs\nAs mentioned above, a site id is an arbitrary number set on a Database Transport to reflect the 'site' to which a record belongs. The site id should be unique for each of the multiple Database Transports using the same external MySQL database to effectively distinguish the content.\nTroubleshooting Database Transports\nIf Cascade is unable to publish to an external database, make sure these guidelines are being followed:\n\nThe server name and port are correct (usually 3306 for MySQL).\nA firewall is not blocking access on the above port.\nThe host that is trying to connect has granted access to the database transport user.\nThe bind-address parameter in the MySQL configuration is not set to localhost or the loopback address.\n\nUseful information in solving these problems can be garnered from the output of a Transport or Destination connectivity test.\nOther Notes\nUntil now, publishing has consisted of moving files to a local or remote file system. Database publishing is more along the lines of synchronizing some portion of the asset hierarchy within Cascade to representative records in an external database. When using database publishing, keep in mind a few of these important items :\n\nRecords inserted during a database publish do not represent the assets in the state in which they would have been published to a file system by simply publishing them. This is particularly true if options are set on relevant targets and destinations that relate to publish-time directory and link manipulation (i.e. remove base folder path, include target path, destination path, etc.).\nLinks in page content are not rewritten during database publishing, and should reflect the in-CMS path of the entities the records represent.\nAfter particular sequences of publishes, deletes, and unpublishes (or lack thereof), the state of the external database should be considered.\n\nFor example, a folder containing two pages:\n\nFolder\n\nPage 1\nPage 2\n\n\n\nThe folder, its pages, and their associated metadata would be written to the external database if a user were to publish this folder to a destination backed by a database transport. Page 1 is then deleted and the folder is republished. If the external database was examined, it would be discovered that Page 1 still has records therein. In database publishing as in normal publishing, it is assumed that users will indicate exactly which assets they want unpublished from their destination. \nIf the same asset is published to destinations using different database transports, this may result in several files, pages, and folders in the external database with the same cms_id. It is important to know what criteria to include in SQL queries to ensure that the correct records are being operated on. The cms_id, the account_id, and the site_id of the assets being operated on should match those on which the user intends to operate. The folder_id of records in the remote database corresponds to the cms_id of its parent folder, and not to the folder_id.\n If a user was dealing with a site with id=5 and an account with id=1, and wanted to get the parent folder of a file named &#8216;koko.png&#8217; in the external database, the file record would appear in the external database like so:\n\nSample database record for 'koko.png'\n\n\n\nid\n\n\naccount_id\n\n\nsite_id\n\n\ncms_id\n\n\nfolder_id\n\n\nmetadata_id\n\n\nname\n\n\npath\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9\n\n\n1\n\n\n5\n\n\n92436e0a7f00010100b2eca959237ccd\n\n\n92436dc67f00010100b2eca953a7298f\n\n\n10\n\n\nkoko.png\n\n\nsite5/images/koko.pn\n\n\n\n\n\nThe desired folder record would appear like so:\n\nSample database record for the parent folder of 'koko.png'\n\n\n\nid\n\n\naccount_id\n\n\nsite_id\n\n\ncms_id\n\n\nfolder_id\n\n\nmetadata_id\n\n\nname\n\n\npath\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n1\n\n\n5\n\n\n92434dc67f00010100b2eca953a7298f\n\n\n9a436dc67f00010100b2eca234526666\n\n\n10\n\n\nimages\n\n\nsite5/image\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to select this record, the correct query would be:\nSELECT * FROM folder WHERE cms_id='92436dc67f00010100b2eca953a7298f' AND site_id=5 AND account_id=1;\nIt is possible that there is another record corresponding to the images folder in the external database with the same cms_id, but with a different account_id, site_id, or both. If the expressions restricting the site_id and account_id were omitted from the query above, multiple folders would be returned in the result. Amazon S3 Transports Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) can be used for hosting static resources such as images, PDFs, CSS, or JS. You can also publish and host entire sites, including page content, on S3 and serve them through a custom domain on CloudFront.\nTo publish using an S3 Transport, you'll need an Access Key, which allows a program, script, or developer to have full programmatic access to the resources on your account. A sample S3 JSON Policy with the minimum required privileges can be found below (replace bucketName with the name of your bucket):\n{\n \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n \"Statement\": [\n {\n \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n \"Action\": [\n \"s3:DeleteObject\",\n \"s3:GetObject\",\n \"s3:PutObject\",\n \"s3:PutObjectAcl\",\n \"s3:ListBucket\"\n ],\n \"Resource\": [\n \"arn:aws:s3:::bucketName/*\",\n \"arn:aws:s3:::bucketName\"\n ]\n }\n ]\n}\nOn-premise Customers Older pre-v8.22.1\n{\n \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n \"Statement\": [\n {\n \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n \"Action\": [\n \"s3:ListAllMyBuckets\"\n ],\n \"Resource\": [\n \"arn:aws:s3:::*\"\n ]\n },\n {\n \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n \"Action\": [\n \"s3:DeleteObject\",\n \"s3:GetObject\",\n \"s3:PutObject\",\n \"s3:PutObjectAcl\"\n ],\n \"Resource\": [\n \"arn:aws:s3:::bucketName/*\"\n ]\n }\n ]\n}\n\nOn-premise customers pre-v8.22.1: the Permissions tab for your S3 bucket must have the Block new public ACLs and uploading public objects option disabled. Without that setting disabled, you may encounter Access Denied errors when attempting to publish to your S3 bucket. Other causes for this error and steps to resolve them can be found on the Amazon S3 Troubleshooting page.\nTo create an Amazon S3 Transport:\n\nNavigate to Manage Site > Transports.\nNavigate to the container in which the new Transport will be stored, or create a new container using Add > Container.\nClick Add > Transport.\nSelect Amazon S3 and click Choose.\nIn the Name field, enter the name for your Transport.\nIn the Parent Container field, select a container for the Transport, if desired.\nUnder Amazon S3 Transport Settings, configure the following fields:\n\nAWS User Access Key ID\nAWS User Secret Key\nS3 Bucket Name - Name of an S3 bucket to which the AWS Access Key user above has write access.\nBase Path - Optional, assets will be published in this folder within your S3 bucket.\n\n\nClick Submit.\n\nLinking\nTo ensure links to assets published to S3, either on their own or as part of a CloudFront distribution, from assets that aren't published there are valid, be sure to use the S3 bucket's URL (including the Base Path) or the CloudFront distribution's URL (including the Base Path) as the site URL or Destination's Web URL.As a best practice, you'll want to manage your S3 published assets in a separate site so the system can easily tell which URL to use when generating links. Testing Transport Connectivity The Transport test utility allows users to test Transport connectivity without invoking a publish. To run a Transport test:\n\nNavigate to Manage Site > Transports.\nSelect the Transport you wish to test.\nClick More > Test Connectivity.\nClick Start Test.

Viewing the Report Once the Broken Links Report has been enabled for your system and run for at least one site, you can view the report under Reports > Broken Links Report.

These links can be grouped by link, which displays all assets containing a particular broken link, or by asset, which displays all broken links found for each asset checked.The results list contains the following information:\n\nSource - The asset in which the broken link was rendered.\nOccurrences -\n\nWhen grouping by link, this column will indicate the number of assets that were found to have been using a particular link.\nWhen grouping by asset, this column will indicate the number of broken links in the current asset.\nClicking Show in this column will display either all assets containing a particular broken link or all links contained in a particular asset depending on whether the report is being grouped by link or by asset, respectively. Clicking Hide will collapse the rows.\n\n\nType -\n\nInternal links are links to resources within the system such as Files or Pages.\nExternal links are links to resources outside the system.\n\n\nLink Description -\n\nFor hyperlinks, the link description is the text contained inside the element or \"Link with no text\".\nFor other types of links, this column will contain a description of the type of tag containing the link to help users locate the link on the page (e.g. \"Broken image source\").\n\n\nBroken Link - This is the value of the attribute that is considered broken. For an <a> tag, this would be the value of the <href> attribute.\n\nHover over or click on the question mark ( ) icon next to the link for more information on why the link is considered broken.\nSee Elements Checked for Broken Links for a full listing of elements and attributes that are checked for broken links.\n\n\nStatus - This column indicates whether or not the broken link has been fixed yet or not.\n\nUsers can click the dropdown and select Fixed to indicate that the link has been fixed in some way, or Ignored to indicate that the link should be excluded from the Link Checker.\nMarking a link as Fixed or Ignored will reduce the number of links that are considered broken in the Broken Links Remaining summary of the report.\nLinks marked as Fixed will be displayed as Fixed for all other users in the system.\nNote that a status of Fixed will revert back to its original value of Broken the next time the Link Checker runs if the link has not actually been fixed inside the corresponding asset.\nThe first row in each set of grouped rows in the report will have two additional values in the status dropdown: Mark all fixed and Mark all broken. These values will mark all grouped rows as either Fixed or Broken, respectively.\n\n\n\nNote - To access the Broken Links report data for a Site, users need the Access site-wide broken link report ability enabled in their Site Role.

Fixing Broken Links To fix a broken link:\n\nLocate the link you'd like to fix in the Broken Link column.\nEdit the asset listed in the Source column.\nYou can either fix the link manually by searching for it in the content of the asset or perform a Check Content & Submit for the asset and fix the link during the broken link content check.\n\nIt's important to note that although a \"source\" asset is listed with each link, the broken link itself may exist in a supporting asset such as a Template, Format, or Block. These and other non-publishable supporting assets don't get checked for broken links directly. When following the steps above, if the broken link can't be found manually or using the on-submit link check, then it's likely that the broken link exists in a supporting asset.

Using complicated HTML elements that rely on positioning or floats can be hit or miss when displayed across different email clients.\nIf you need to position elements, use a table instead of a div. Avoid empty td elements and use cellpadding for spacing. You can add a role=\"presentation\" attribute to your table to avoid screen readers treating it like tabular data.\nWhile extremely popular in web design, SVG images have limited support among email clients. Use PNG, JPG, or GIF as an alternative.\nUse fully-qualified, absolute links for images and be sure to include alt text attributes in case images are blocked by an email client.\nImages can be made responsive by adding the responsive class to the img tag.\nUse inline styles (optionally, with !important) to add or override styling for your content.\nTry to keep your total email size under 100kb to avoid getting caught in spam filters and having email clients such as Gmail clipping your content. Using Custom Workflow Emails Use your Custom Workflow Emails by attaching them to one or more Workflow Definitions in the Properties tab under Custom Workflow Emails.\nWhen attaching Custom Workflow Emails to a Workflow Definition, you can specify two types of emails: notification and completion.\n\nNotification emails are sent when an Email trigger's mode is notify (or not specified) and should be used when a workflow requires the recipient to take action to move a workflow forward.\nCompletion emails are sent when an Email trigger's mode is completed and should be used when a workflow is finished to provide the workflow owner information about the results of the workflow via the comments.",

    "title": "Copy Folder Trigger",
    "category": "Content Management",
    "body": "Overview The Copy Folder Trigger copies the parent folder of an asset in workflow to a location designated by a parameter passed to the trigger. It also realigns structured data asset choosers for assets contained in the folder being copied so that the user does not have to realign the asset choosers manually. Example: There exists a page 'p1' in folder 'a' that has a page chooser that points to a page 'p2' residing in folder 'a/b' (a child folder of 'a'). If folder 'a' is put into workflow and the Copy Folder Trigger is invoked, the page chooser in the copied 'p1' page will point to the page 'p2' in the new 'a/b' folder, rather than the page 'p2' contained in the original 'a/b' folder. Declaration Usage Parameters destPath The destPath parameter is used to determine where the parent folder should publish to. If more than one location is required, these can be delimited by commas (\",\") within the same parameter.\nbasePath The basePath parameter is used when the folder to be copied should be copied into a sub-folder of the folder designated by the destPath parameter. By default, this parameter is given the value of the path of the parent folder of the folder being copied. This default ensures that any folders copied with the trigger will be created as a direct descendant of the destination folder.\nSetting this parameter to a value that is higher in the folder hierarchy than the parent of the folder being copied makes it possible to use the Copy Folder Trigger to copy folders at any level deep below the folder corresponding to basePath to an analogous folder found in the destination folder.\nFor example, say there exists a folder '/base' (a direct child of the system base folder) which contains a folder 'a' which contains a folder 'b'; and the destPath has been specified as '/dest' (also a direct child of the system base folder). Assume the basePath has been set to '/base'. Starting a workflow that uses the Copy Folder Trigger on an asset inside folder 'b' would cause the folder 'b' to be copied into the folder with path '/dest/a' (resulting in a folder with path '/dest/a/b'), because folder 'a' was below the folder designated as the basePath folder. Note that folder '/dest/a' has to exist before folder 'b' can be copied into it. The trigger will not automatically create a sub-tree of folders. The idea is that one would first use the Copy Folder Trigger to copy folder 'a' to all destPaths, and then folder 'b' would be created so that it could be copied after 'a' had been copied. If the goal is simply to copy an entire folder tree to another location, then this would not be necessary; a single folder copy would do the job. If, however, the goal is to incrementally copy folders and subfolders inside a particular 'base' folder to another specified location, you would use this parameter.\nincludeAssetInWorkflow This parameter indicates whether or not the asset originally put into workflow will be copied to the new location. It defaults to false.\nIt does not make sense to set this parameter to true if the asset is in a create workflow and has not been merged (using the Merge workflow trigger), because the asset is still a working copy and cannot be copied to a new location. Required Intermediate Step The Copy Folder Trigger requires an intermediate transition step assigned to a default user that cannot be touched by any regular users. This intermediate step prevents users from clicking through the workflow before the Copy Folder Trigger has finished its copy. The intermediate step requires one action that moves to the next desired step after the copy is complete.\nExample:",

    "body": "Overview This workflow trigger instantiates workflows for analogous assets to support translation capabilites or cross-site content synchronization.This workflow trigger works on the premise that a client has their content set up in the following structure:\n\nen\nde\nfr\n\nAssume the internet folder has a target named internet with base folder internet. Assume each of the subfolders has an asset \"page\" in them. These are the \"analogous assets\". Analagous assets must have the same name for this plugin to work.Whenever one of these analogous assets is edited and placed into a workflow containing this trigger, this trigger will start corresponding edit workflows for the other two analogous assets. For example if /internet/en/page was edited, /internet/de/page and /internet/fr/page would be put into an edit workflow of the user's specification (denoted by the invoked-workflow-definition-path parameter). Declaration Usage Parameters The trigger is capable of taking multiple parameters of the same name.\nInvoked-Workflow-Destination-Path Parameter\nThe path of the Workflow Definition to be used by the trigger (e.g. Internet/1-Step-Edit-WF). \nInvoked-Workflow-Definition-Site-Name Parameter\nSite name where the Workflow Definition is located. If no explicit Site is specified, the Workflow Definition is assumed to be in same Site as the asset in workflow.\nTarget Parameter\nThe target parameter specifies a target path that will be used to calculate the analogous asset paths. For this trigger to work properly, the target structure should mirror the folder structure, such that each individual folder (en, de, fr) has its own target (en, de, fr). In this example, a workflow is started on /internet/en/page, with additional workflows created for /internet/de/page and /internet/fr/page. The target parameter is set based on the workflows to be started - /internet/de, with the /internet/de folder as its base folder and /internet/fr, with the /interent/fr folder as its base folder.\nFolder-Path Parameter\nAlternatively, the folder-path parameter can be used which explicitly specifies the analogous assets&#8217; base folders explained above.\nBase-Folder Parameter\nThe base-folder parameter should specify base folder for current asset, meaning the asset on which this workflow is being executed on. In the example above it would be /internet/en.\nIn this example the relative folder path would be /fr for the French site and /de for the German site. Then the trigger will attempt to locate the analogous asset by building a path of the form $COMMON + $RELATIVE + $ASSET_NAME, which would yield /internet/fr/page and /internet/de/page for French and German sites, respectively. It then instantiates those assets into the edit workflow specified by invoked-workflow-definition-path whose owner will be specified by the owner parameter.\nThis trigger also handles creates and copies. For creates, when an asset is created a new additional asset with the same name and same data should be created in the folders where the other analogous assets live. The same goes for copies.\nIn total, the user will need to set up two workflow definitions (create, edit, copy) on each analogous folder. One workflow definition will be the workflow definition containing this trigger, which will spawn the workflows for the analogous assets. The other workflow definitions are the ones that will be spawned when an asset in some other analogous folder is created, edited, or copied.\nIn this example the administrator would set up the trigger in the workflow on the \"en\" folder to have the triggers set as such: to handle \"de\" and to handle \"fr\".",

This way when a user makes changes and submits the asset back to the original user, who then reviews it, the asset will not go back to the group but to the user (who selected Assign to Me) for publishing. Declaration Usage For example, if you have a step assigned to a group and one of the options was to \"Edit\" as well as a separate option to \"Approve\", you would put the Preserve Current User Trigger as a trigger for both steps, assuming you want the user preserved instead of the group assignment.

    "body": "Overview This trigger publishes or unpublishes the current asset in workflow (if publishable) to all enabled Destinations available to the user authorizing the publish.\nWhen using the Publish trigger, the system differentiates between Transition steps and System steps.

Declaration Usage Parameters The following parameters can be used within the invocation of the Publish Trigger to change the behavior in which the asset is (un)published.\nDestination\nBy default, the system will publish to all applicable Destinations. You can publish to specific Destination(s) by using the destination parameter. To use the parameter, simply replace /path/to/destination with the full path to the Destination in the Manage Site area of your Site.\nFor example, if your Destination is in the root Destination Container and named WWW Production, you would replace /path/to/destination with WWW Production. If WWW Production happens to be within a Container named Primary, you would replace /path/to/destination with Primary/WWW Production.\nNote - the path to the Destination is case sensitive.\nYou can specify multiple destinations by putting in multiple parameter nodes, each containing a name and value tag, such as: Publish Working Copy\nIt is also possible to publish the working copy of a page in workflow for staging purposes. This can be accomplished by adding a publish-working-copy parameter to the invocation of the Publish Trigger in a Workflow Definition with a value of true. By default (without this parameter) only the non-working copy version of the asset in workflow is published. Unpublish\nIf the asset is meant to be unpublished, the unpublish parameter can be used, which accepts boolean values true or false (default).\nThis parameter works together with other parameters in this trigger so that it is possible to unpublish an asset using a given authorizing user, to unpublish a working copy, and to unpublish only from specified Destinations. This trigger can be useful when moving or renaming an asset through Workflow. Authorizing Type\nThe authorizing-type parameter is used to specify which user is \"authorizing\" the publish in this step. This will affect permissions/roles checks performed during publish and also to whom the publish report is delivered to.\nAuthorizing-type can take the following values:\n\ncurrent-step-owner - the user assigned to the step that calls the trigger\nsystem - the reserved \"system\" user, which can be used to bypass all permission and role ability checks and results in the publish report not being sent to anyone.\nuser - a specified user Note - To specify a user, leave the authorizing-type set to the string literal 'user'. Then, provide the specific username you wish to use in the corresponding authorizing-user parameter (see the section below titled Authorizing User).\nAuthorizing User\nThe authorizing-user parameter is used in conjunction with the user authorizing-type. This parameter's value should be any valid username in the system. Note - the username value is case sensitive.\nPublish Related Assets\nThe publish-related-assets parameter can be used to ensure that the asset's publishable relationships are also published. Publish Related Publish Set\nThe publish-related-publishset parameter can be used to ensure that the page's Content Type Publish Set is also published.",

    "body": "Overview Shared Fields allow you to manage, update, and share fields and field groups across Data Definitions and across sites.\nFor example, you may maintain drop-down or multi-select lists for departments or academic majors. Or you may have field groups for creating contact information blocks or image carousels. If you need to add or remove an item from your list or field group, Shared Fields will let you update it one time, from one location, and the changes will immediately be made available in all Data Definitions using that field or field group. Creating Shared Fields To created a shared field:\n\nNavigate to Manage Site > Shared Fields.\nNavigate to the container in which the new Shared Field will be stored, or create a new container using Add > Container.\nClick Add > Shared Field.\nSelect the type of Shared Field you'd like to create and click Choose.\n\nNote that only the Group Shared Field type can contain multiple fields or have additional fields added after creation.\n\n\nIn the Name field, enter a name for your Shared Field.\nIn the Parent Container field, select a container for the Shared Field, if desired.\nIn the Builder tab, configure the settings for your Shared Field or build a field group using the field types available in the toolbar. See Data Definitions for more information on field types and options.\nClick Submit to save your Shared Field. Adding Shared Fields to Data Definitions To add a Shared Field to a Data Definition:\n\nCreate a new Data Definition or edit an existing one.\nIn the Builder tab, click and drag a field corresponding to your Shared Field's type to the desired location in your Data Definition.\nClick Choose Shared Field.\n\nBy default, only Shared Fields of the same type as the field chosen will be available in the chooser panel.\nYou can select a different field type by clicking the Show all field types link.\n\n\nSelect your Shared Field and click Choose.\nIn the Field Properties menu, configure any field settings you wish to override such as identifier, label, or whether the field is required.\n\nField settings that are overridden at the Data Definition level won't be updated when the corresponding setting is updated at the Shared Field level.\nField settings that are grayed out aren't able to be overridden and must be configured at the Shared Field level.\n\n\nClick Save.\n\nTip - You can add the same Shared Field to a Data Definition multiple times, but the fields must have unique identifiers if they're contained in the same group. Replacing Fields with Shared Fields Existing fields or field groups in a Data Definition can be replaced with a Shared Field so long as the identifier and type of the existing field and the identifier and type of the Shared Field are identical.\nTo replace an existing field or field group with a Shared Field:\n\nEdit your Data Definition.\nEdit the existing field or field group by clicking the pencil icon ( ) next to it.\nClick Choose Shared Field.\nSelect your Shared Field and click Choose.\nIn the Field Properties menu, configure any field settings you wish to override such as identifier, label, or whether the field is required.\n\nThe Identifier field must match the existing field's identifier exactly.\nFor Shared Field groups, the group Identifier field and identifiers and types of all contained fields must also match exactly. Contained field identifiers can't be overridden at the Data Definition level and must be configured in the Shared Field itself.\n\n\nClick Save.\n\nWarning - To avoid data loss when replacing existing fields with Shared Fields, ensure the field type and identifier of the Shared Field matches the field type and identifier of the existing field exactly. When replacing field groups, overall group identifiers must be identical and all contained fields must also have identical identifiers and field types. Mismatched field identifiers and/or field types will result in existing field content being discarded when the asset is next submitted.",

    "title": "Smart Fields",
    "category": "Design In Cascade",
    "body": "Overview With Smart Fields, you can selectively show fields and field groups in a Data Definition based on values selected in checkbox, drop-down, radio, and multi-select fields.\nFor example, you may choose to reveal a set of fields for contact information is a \"Contact Information\" checkbox is enabled. Or a \"Column Type\" radio field may reveal a WYSIWYG if \"Text\" is selected and an image chooser field if \"Image\" is selected.\nRequired fields or fields with content validated with regular expressions but are hidden due to Smart Field rules are not validated on submit. This allows you to create conditionally-required and conditionally-validated fields in Data Definitions. Creating Smart Fields Smart Fields are created by editing the Show Fields property for values in a checkbox, radio button, drop-down, or multi-select field and selecting which fields or field groups should be revealed when that value is selected.\nTo set up Smart Fields in the Data Definition Builder:\n\nCreate or edit your Data Definition.\nCreate or edit a checkbox, radio button, drop-down, or multi-select field.\nIn the Show Fields field associated with each Value, select the field and/or field groups that should be shown when that value is selected.\n\nTo set up Smart Fields in the XML view:\n\nCreate or edit your Data Definition.\nAdd a show-fields attribute to the <item> containing the value that should reveal the other fields or groups or fields.\nEnter a comma-separated list of field identifiers. For fields inside of groups, use a slash / to indicate the group nesting, e.g. group1/inside-field.\n\nNote - When editing a Data Definition, all fields are visible regardless of Smart Field rules. Help text below each field affected by Smart Field rules explains when these fields will be shown.\nTip - When viewing a Data Definition, use the Apply Smart Field rules toggle to preview your form with Smart Field rules applied. Example A use case that demonstrates a few different features of Smart Fields is a form with fields for an address including a \"Country\" dropdown and associated zip-code field.\nWhen the Country \"United States\" is selected, a \"5 digit zip code\" field could be revealed whereas when \"Canada\" is selected, a \"6 character postal code\" field could be shown. If the \"Country\" field has no value selected, both \"5 digit zip code\" and \"6 character postal code\" fields could be hidden. These rules can stack up as well. In the example above, we could have an \"Include Address?\" checkbox with the \"Country\" show-field selected. This would automatically cause the \"Country\" field, \"5 digit zip code\", and \"6 character postal code\" fields to be hidden by default when the \"Show Address?\" checkbox is unchecked, even if the \"Country\" field has a default value selected. This is because for the Smart Field rules, hidden fields count as if they had no value selected. Groups of fields can also be progressively disclosed, which would result in the group being hidden by default unless a specific value is selected. In the example above, the \"Country\", \"5 digit zip code\", and \"6 character postal code\" fields could be inside of \"Address\" group. Then, the \"Include Address?\" checkbox could have the \"Address\" group selected as a show-field. Smart Fields and In-context Editing When editing a page in-context, only the fields selected to be editable in-context for a given region are included in Smart Field rules.\nFor example, if only the \"Address\" group from the example above is selected to appear in an in-context editable region and the \"Include Address?\" checkbox is not selected, the \"Address\" group will be always visible. The Smart Field rules configured for the \"Include Address?\" field will be ignored because it's not included in the editable region. Smart Fields and Structured Data Smart Field rules don't affect the structured data rendered on pages or in index blocks. This is important when writing Formats because you can assume all fields will always be visible.\nAs a Format writer, you may need to check the values of fields you're using to reveal other fields. For example, a field such as the \"Country\" dropdown in the example above may have a value set but may not be shown due to the fact that \"Include address?\" is not checked. Before outputting the \"Country\" field in your format, you'll want to check the value of \"Include Address?\" instead of just checking for the presence of a value for the \"Country\" field.",

    "id": "developing-in-cascade-code-sections",
    "title": "Code Sections",
    "category": "Developing In Cascade",
    "body": "Passthrough Code Sections Passthrough code sections instruct the interpreter to exclude the enclosed code when the page is being previewed internally. Upon publishing, the contents of these tags will be uncommented and included in the final page.\nThe passthrough code section is delimited as follows: This deprecated way is also allowed: When viewing a file or page containing these types of blocks within the CMS, these sections are left untouched unless the asset is a page with serialization type of PDF or RTF (as determined by the Target associated with the page's Template). If the serialization type is PDF or RTF the section is simply stripped from the code.\nWhen publishing a file or page containing these blocks to a location outside the CMS, these sections are rewritten so that the enclosing comments and # passthrough strings are removed. However, when publishing a page with PDF or RTF serialization type, these sections are once again completely removed rather than rewritten.\nFor example, suppose we wanted to embed the following PHP code in a page: Wrapping the passthrough code comment tags allows the page to validate as XML: When viewing this page in the system, this code would remain inside of the comments untouched; and the PHP code will not render (unless a PDF or RTF configuration of a page is viewed, in which case the comments and the code would be removed).\nHowever, upon publishing to a file with serialization type of HTML or XML, the comment tags are stripped out leaving only the valid PHP code.\nWhen publishing to a PDF or RTF file, or viewing a PDF or RTF configuration of the page within the system, the comments and the code would both be stripped out. Passthrough-Top Code Sections Tags The second type of code section currently supported in the system is the passthrough-top code section, which is delimited as follows: This deprecated way is also allowed: The passthrough-top code section is used to support code that must be placed at the very beginning of a document (file or page) &#8211; for example, an ASP page that requires a processing instruction before the page's DOCTYPE. Because the system does not allow for XML comments before the root element or DOCTYPE in a template, such code must be placed inside of a root code section.\nThe rules for rendering these code sections both inside and outside of the CMS are the same as for the passthrough code section with one notable difference - when publishing to a file or page with serialization type HTML or XML, the comment tags are removed, but the code inside the comments is actually moved to the beginning of the document. This can be useful if, for example, you need to include a page redirect at the top of the page, but you are using a template that does not have a content region defined at the very top.\nFor example, suppose you have the following .NET template: Therefore, when a page using this template was published, the ASP instructions would appear before the page's DOCTYPE.\nThe following root code section tags could be used to create this template in the CMS: If there were multiple passthrough-top code sections in a page or file, they would be placed sequentially at the top of the document in the relative order that they appeared. Protect Code Sections Tags These code sections work the same as passthrough code sections with the exception that protect code sections are also rendered inside of Cascade CMS. Because of that, the purpose of these code sections is shifted from outputting server side code to client side code such as Javascript. This also allows outputting unbalanced XML for old browser support.\nProtect code sections are delimited as follows: or Using the CDATA format allows for special sequences of characters to be entered, such as -- which is commonly used in JavaScript as a decrement operation. During the last stage of rendering a Page, the special wrapping tags are stripped leaving the text ...put any code here... in the example above.\nBelow you will find an example that outputs unbalanced XML that could be used to aid the support of older web browsers. This will result in following code which normally (without use of code sections) would not be allowed by Cascade CMS: Protect-Top Code Sections Tags These code sections work just as passthrough-top code sections but again with the exception that protect-top code sections are also rendered inside of Cascade CMS. You can use these code sections to output a non-standard doctype, use Cascade CMS pages to dynamically render non XML content such as JavaScript, CSS or JSON, or output the HTML 5 Boilerplate code.\nThe syntax for client root code section is delimited as follows: or During the last stage of rendering the page, the special syntax is stripped leaving the text ...put any code here... in the example above and that text is then being moved above the XML document.\nThe following code can be used to output the HTML 5 Boilerplate (h5bp) code: The result of this code will be: Cascade Skip Tags In some situations it is useful to completely remove part of the code. This is possible through outputting # cascade-skip tag inside of HTML comments. For example, the code below: will result with the <unnecessary-tag/> being removed after the page finishes rendering, right before it is published out or outputted to the screen: Placing only one <!--# cascade-skip--> tag results with the remaining contents being fully stripped. This is especially useful together with the # protect-top tag. For example, this valid XML document: will result with a pure JavaScript code completely stripped of XML tags: A practical real life scenario would involve constructing an XSLT or Velocity format that dynamically renders contents inside of the protect-top code section in example above to get a result with dynamically generated JavaScript code.",

Cascade CMS 8.1.1 New methods exposed on objects\nAsset now expose a label property $asset.label that returns Display Name, Title, or the asset's system name -- whichever is populated first. This is convenience method for quickly accessing this information. 8.0.2 New API objects\n\nNew API object com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.admin.Site that represents a Site asset\n\nThis object inherits all methods from PermissionsCapableAsset\nIn addition to these methods, it has getUrl() method that returns String URL of the Site.\n\n\nNew class that API objects inherit from com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.admin.SiteManagementAreaAsset\n\nThis class inherits from com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.PermissionsCapableAsset\nIt contains method getSite() which returns com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.admin.Site, which is a Site in which the asset is located.\n\n\nAPI objects that now inherit from com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.admin.SiteManagementAreaAsset:\n\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.admin.DestinationContainer\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.admin.Transport\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.admin.Destination\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.admin.AssetFactory\n\n\n\nNew methods in existing API objects\n\nNew method in com.hannonhill.cascade.webservice.schema.FolderContainedAsset\n\ngetSite() - returns com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.admin.Site, which is a Site in which the asset is located.\n\n\nNew method in com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.BaseAsset\n\ngetAssetType() - returns a String that represents the type of the current asset, equivalent to calling getIdentifer().getType().toString()\n\n\nNew method in com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.Block\n\ngetBlockType() - returns a String that represents type of the block\n\n\nNew method in com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.Format\n\ngetFormatType() - returns a String that represents type of the format\n\n\nNew method in com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.MetadataAwareAsset\n\ngetLinkingAssets() - returns a List of com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.FolderContainedAssetsthat contain links to this asset in their content through [system-asset] links, links in XML/XHTML and data definition chooser fields.\n\n\n\nRemoved objects and methods\n\nRemoved API object com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.admin.Target\nRemoved methods from com.cms.publish.PublishTriggerInformation\n\ngetTargetId()\nsetTargetId(String targetId)\ngetTargetPath()\nsetTargetPath(String targetPath) 8.0 Improvements\n\nStructuredDataNode.getAsset() will now return null if the node's assigned asset is recycled.\nAdded FeedBlock.getFeedAsXMLElement(),which will return the feed content as a JDOM Element. This Element will always refer to a \"system-xml\" element that wraps the content of the feed itself. This is a convenience method which allows the feed content to be traversed in a DOM structure as opposed to a String. 7.8 Fixed\n\nFixed File.getData() so that it doesn't throw LazyInitializationException (CSI-680)\nFixed File.getData().getSize() so that it returns real size instead of \"0\" (CSI-681)\n\nImprovements\n\nAdded File.getText() to get content of File as UTF8 string (CSI-682)\nAdded support for root-relative XPath expressions (e.g. /path/to/element) for XML returned from \"get...AsXMLElement\" API methods (CSI-683)\nAdded File.getFileSize() that works just as File.getData().getSize() but returns results much quicker because it does not need fetch the data 7.6 New API methods\n\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.Metadata:\n\ngetDynamicField(String name): Finds a dynamic metadata field by name\n\n\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.DynamicMetadataField:\n\ngetValue(): Get a single value for the DynamicMetadataField. If the field has more than 1 value, only the first is returned\n\n\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.StructuredDataNode:\n\ngetChildren(): Same as StructuredDataNode.getGroup() but the method name is more in line with the two other methods added to StructuredDataNode\ngetChildren(String identifier): Returns all children of a group StructuredDataNode that match the supplied identifier\ngetChild(String identifier): Returns the first child of a group StructuredDataNode that matches the supplied identifier\n\n\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.StructuredDataCapableAsset (com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.Page and com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.XHTMLDataDefinitionBlock)\n\ngetStructuredDataNodes(String path): Finds all StructuredDataNodes that match the supplied path 7.4 New API methods\n\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.FeedBlock.getFeed() - Will fetch feed contents\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.FolderContainedAsset.getSiteName() - Returns the name of the asset&#8217;s site\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.StructuredDataCapableAsset\n\ngetDefinitionPath() - Returns the Data Definition&#8217;s path if Data Definition is assigned\ngetStructuredDataNode(path) - Will return a structured data node by path using group names, for example &#8220;address/city&#8221; if the Data Definition has a group &#8220;address&#8221; with a field &#8220;city&#8221; inside of that group\n\n\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.PublishableAsset:\n\ngetLastPublishedBy() - Returns name of a user who last published the asset\ngetLastPublishedOn() - Returns date when the asset was last published\ngetShouldBeIndexed() - Returns true of the asset is enabled for indexing\nsetIncludeWhenIndexing() - Enabled or disabled the asset for indexing\ngetLink() - Returns a link in the same format as in Index Blocks (site://sitename/path/to/asset)\n\n\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.Reference.getReferencedAsset() - Returns the referenced asset\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.StructuredDataNode.getAsset() - Similar to existing getAssetIdentifier() method but this will return the actual asset\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.PermissionsCapableAsset has been added to the hierarchy. The following classes extend it:\n\nAssetFactory\nDestination\nDestinationContainer\nFolderContainedAsset\nTransport\n\n\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.PermissionsCapableAsset contains the following methods:\n\nisCurrentUserCanRead() - Returns true if current user has read access to the asset\nisCurrentUserCanWrite() - Returns true if current user has write access to the asset\nisUserCanRead(username) - Returns true if a user with given username has read access to the asset\nisUserCanWrite(username) - Returns true if a user with given username has write access to the asset\n\n\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.Page.getXHTMLAsXMLElement(), StructuredDataNode.getTextValueAsXMLElement() (WYSIWYG fields only), XHTMLDataDefinitionBlock.getXHTMLAsXMLElement(), XMLBlock.getXMLAsXMLElement() - Returns the same contents as the counterpart methods which do not cantain &#8220;AsXMLElement&#8221; in their name return, with the difference that these &#8220;...AsXMLElement&#8221; methods return JDOM Element objects as opposed to Strings. The Element object is always a &#8220;system-xml&#8221; element whose children are the actual contents. These methods are useful when using the API in a Velocity Format as you can use the XPathTool to filter them.\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.DynamicMetadataField.setValues() - Allows changing values of dynamic metadata fields\n\nModifications to Existing API Methods\n\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.Page.getXHTML(), StructuredDataNode.getTextValue() (WYSIWYG fields only), XHTMLDataDefinitionBlock.getXHTML(), XMLBlock.getXML() - will return String XML with links rewritten to cross-site links, for example a path in format &#8220;/path/to/asset&#8221; will be converted to &#8220;site://sitename/path/to/asset&#8221;\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.MetadataAwareAsset - Dynamic fields will now be compared to metadata set and mapped accordingly. For example, if metadata set gets updated and gets a new field added with default values, then the corresponding MetadataAwareAsset will have the new field with default values populated without the asset having to be manually re-edited. Similarly, if a metadata set gets updates and gets an existing dynamic metadata field removed, then the corresponding MetadataAwareAsset will not have that field anymore without having to re-edit that asset.\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.StructuredDataCapableAsset - Similarly to the above, the structured data fields will be mapped according to the current version of the Data Definition.\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.DynamicMetadataField does not extend NamedAsset anymore 7.2.2 com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.MetadataAwareAsset: Fixed issue where using getMetadata().getDynamicFields() would cause a NullPointerException when used from within an Asset Factory Plugin CSI-549\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.PathIdentifier: Fixed issue where getPath() returns NULL assets other than pages CSI-546 7.2 com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.DynamicMetadataField: New isMultiSelect() method has been added which returns true if the dynamic metadata field is a multi-select field. In the past, if the isDropdown() method returned true, then isMultiple() would be called to determine if the field was a multi-select.\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.DynamicMetadataField: The isMultiple() method has been removed. 6.8 com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.Page: A new method, setXHTML(String xhtml), has been added which allows the XHTML of a Page to be changed via the API.\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.StructuredDataNode: Two new methods have been added: setTextValue(String value) and setTextValues(String[] values). The first method allows the text of a single value StructuredDataNode to be set. The second method allows the text of a multi-value StructuredDataNode to be set (e.g. a multi-select or checkbox StructuredDataNode).\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.common.DynamicMetadataField: A new method, setValue(String value), has been added which allows the value of a DynamicMetadataField to be changed via the API. This only supports single value DynamicMetadataFields.\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.operation.Create: A new method, newAPIAsset(BaseAsset asset), has been added to aid with creation of assets in Asset Factory Plugins. This method will take an existing asset and create a new object using the properties that exist on the existing asset. This ensures that all required properties are populated on a new API object so that it can successfully be created using the Create operation. 6.7.3 For Publish operation, changed setMode() and getMode() methods to accept and return a String object with following possible values: Publish.MODE_PUBLISH and Publish.MODE_UNPUBLISH. 6.7 com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.FolderContainedAsset - two new methods: setHideSystemName and isHideSystemName. This is used to hide the System Name field on creation with an Asset Factory Plugin. \n\nSee com.cms.assetfactory.DisplayToSystemNamePlugin#doPluginActionPre() for an example of how this change is used.\n\n\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.adapters.XHTMLBlockAPIAdapter is now com.hannonhill.cascade.api.adapters.XHTMLDataDefinitionBlockAPIAdapter\ncom.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.XHTMLBlock is now com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.XHTMLDataDefinitionBlock 5.7.2 Added the isUnpublish() method to the PublishTriggerInformation object which indicates whether or not the current job is marked as an un-publish 5.7 Renamed com.hannonhill.cascade.model.dom.identifier.home.StylesheetIdentifier to com.hannonhill.cascade.model.dom.identifier.home.FormatIdentifier\nAdded com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.Format\nAdded com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.ScriptFormat\nBoth com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.XSLTFormats and com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.ScriptFormats use the com.hannonhill.cascade.model.dom.identifier.home.FormatIdentifier\nRenamed com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.Stylesheet to com.hannonhill.cascade.api.asset.home.XSLTFormat",

    "title": "Publish Triggers",
    "category": "Developing In Cascade",
    "body": "Overview Publish Triggers are plug-ins that can be utilized during the publishing process. They allow developers to execute custom logic each time an asset (page, file, or other content item) is published.\nFor example, a publish trigger may be set up so that each time a particular page is edited and published, an e-mail is sent to notify users (or even non-Cascade users) that may be interested in that page's publication. Publish Trigger Pre-Requisites Use of the Publish Trigger SDK requires that you have moderate knowledge of Java programming.\n\nEnsure you have version 6 or later of the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer.\nEnsure you are running Cascade 8.0.x or later.\nDownload the Eclipse IDE.\nClone the repository and checkout the 8.0.x branch or download the SDK from the Hannon Hill GitHub repository.\n\nIf you do not want to use Eclipse, you can develop against the publish trigger API JAR and the general Cascade API JAR to access other assets from Publish Triggers. Installing Eclipse and Opening the SDK Once Eclipse is downloaded, it needs to be unzipped to a directory of your choosing (suggestions: c:\\java\\eclipse or c:\\Program Files\\Eclipse on Windows, /usr/local/eclipse on Linux, or &#126;/java/eclipse on OS X).\nStart Eclipse and you will be prompted to choose a workspace location &#8211; the default location should suffice. Make note of this location, as it is where the SDK will also be unzipped.\nUnzip the SDK plug-in to your workspace directory. The zip should create its own directory inside your workspace directory.\nLoad the SDK (which is actually just an Eclipse project) into Eclipse. To do so, right-click in the Package Explorer view on the left-hand side, and select \"Import...\". Then select \"Existing Projects Into Workspace\" under &#8216;General&#8217; and click Next. Select \"Browse\" (next to \"Select root directory:\") and navigate to the directory created when you unzipped the SDK. You should then see \"Cascade Publish Trigger\" under &#8216;Projects&#8217;. Click Finish.\n\nYou should now see the project in your Package Explorer. The project already has a pre-created package and starter plug-in named com.mycompany.cascade.plugin.SimplePublishTrigger. Feel free to delete/rename/move this plug-in to suit your needs. Writing the Publish Trigger Plug-In Class A plug-in is a Java class that implements the PublishTrigger interface. The plug-in writer will need to implement the following methods defined on this interface: This method provides the PublishTrigger implementation with an information object, which is a simple JavaBean containing information about the asset currently being published. This is called before invoke(), and generally, the PublishTrigger implementation will simply store this for use during the invoke() method, in which the PublishTrigger implementation will perform its actual logic. This method is called once per item published. This method provides the PublishTrigger implementation with parameters as set in the PublishTrigger XML configuration file. This method is called once per parameter listed in the Publish Trigger configuration XML file, immediately after the PublishTrigger implementation is constructed. This method is where the core logic of the PublishTrigger implementation should be written. It is called once per item published, immediately after setPublishInformation is called. Note that the PublishTrigger implementation provided must provide a default, no-args constructor. Publish Trigger Lifecycle PublishTrigger implementations are constructed once per logical publish. Once a PublishTrigger implementation is constructed, it is initialized once by passing in all of the parameters defined for that trigger from the Publish Trigger configuration XML file. Then, it&#8217;s setPublishInformation and invoke methods will be called once per asset published. Once the logical publish ends, the PublishTriggers are discarded and garbage collected. Deploying the Publish Trigger Once the custom code is written, package your code into a JAR, including any custom helper classes. If your PublishTrigger implementation relies on any other outside libraries, these libraries will be copied to the same place as the JAR containing the custom code.Place these JAR file(s) in the following directory: <Cascade Installation Directory>/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib. For advanced users that do not have their Cascade CMS deployed as the root web application (non-standard configuration), these files will need to be placed in the corresponding context directory inside of the webapps directory. For example, if Cascade CMS is deployed at the \"cms\" context, the files would be placed at <Cascade Installation Directory>/webapps/cms/WEB-INF/lib.Restart Cascade CMS.\nNote - It's good practice to store any custom code developed for Cascade CMS in the base of the Cascade CMS installation directory as well. This is because these custom files, once deployed, may be overwritten each time the Cascade CMS software is upgraded. For instance, storing a backup of these files inside of <Cascade Installation Directory>/cascade-custom-code is strongly suggested. Publish Trigger Configuration To manage Publish Triggers, click the system menu button ( ) > Administration > Publish Triggers. Only users with the Modify Configuration Files ability enabled in their System Role can configure Publish Triggers.A trigger is comprised of a package-qualified Java classname and any associated parameters. Click Add Trigger to add additional triggers and Add Trigger Parameters to add additional parameters.Multiple triggers can be defined. In fact, the same trigger class could be defined multiple times with different parameters.For backwards compatibility and to allow easy copying of trigger configurations from one instance of Cascade CMS to another, there is an XML pane that contains the complete configuration.\nNote - A JAR file containing the trigger classes must be deployed before startup when attempting to add them to the configuration. Trigger classnames are validated on submission. If the class cannot be found, submission will fail.

For example: http://localhost:8080/ws/services/AssetOperationService?wsdl.\nTo read the WSDL file for given parameter, first search for a <complexType> tag with given name parameter. For example, moveParameters definition in WSDL can be found by searching for <complexType name=\"moveParameters\">. In that case, the result will be:\n<sequence> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"1\" name=\"destinationContainerIdentifier\" nillable=\"false\" type=\"impl:identifier\"/> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"1\" name=\"doWorkflow\" nillable=\"false\" type=\"xsd:boolean\"/> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"1\" name=\"newName\" nillable=\"false\" type=\"xsd:string\"/></sequence> \nIf type is of impl:..., it means that there is another <complextType> or <simpleType> tag with given name, for example <complexType name=\"identifier\">. This has its own structure:\n<sequence> <!-- When editing and selected asset is recycled, it is recommended to preserve this relationship by providing selected asset's id in case if the selected asset gets restored from the recycle bin.

Ignored when editing, copying etc. --> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"0\" name=\"recycled\" type=\"xsd:boolean\"/></sequence> \nValue 0 in minOccurs means that the property is optional.

An easy way to understand its structure is by simply performing a read operation on an existing asset in the system. If you would like to create an asset (a page for instance), it would be useful to read a similar asset first to see the proper structure of asset property. The same object can even be reused for create operation with just tweaked parameters. Similarly, the easiest way to edit an asset is by reading it first and reusing the read asset object.",

If you pass seconds, your date will land near 1970.\n.getDate examples\nMany $currentPage properties already return Date objects, so you can format them directly without conversion:\n## These already return Date objects - no conversion needed\n$currentPage.lastPublishedOn ## Date of last publish\n$currentPage.createdOn ## Date asset was created\n$currentPage.lastModified ## Date of last modification\n\n## Get the current date/time\n$_DateTool.getDate()\nFormat these dates directly:\n## Format the last published date for a byline\nPublished $_DateTool.format(\"MMM d, yyyy\", $currentPage.lastPublishedOn)\n## Output: Published Jan 15, 2026\n\n## Format creation date\nCreated $_DateTool.format(\"MMMM d, yyyy\", $currentPage.createdOn)\n## Output: Created January 10, 2026\nData Definition date/time fields store timestamps as strings, so you need to convert them with getDate() before formatting:\n## Format a date/time field from a Data Definition\n#set ($dateNode = $currentPage.getStructuredDataNode(\"date-time\").textValue)#set ($eventDate = $_DateTool.getDate($dateNode))$_DateTool.format(\"MMMM d, yyyy\", $eventDate)\n## Output: March 15, 2026\n.toDate examples\nUse toDate() when you have a date as a string and need to parse it into a Date object:\n## Parse a date string - pattern must match the input format exactly\n#set ($dateString = \"03-21-2024\")\n#set ($date = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yyyy\", $dateString))\n$_DateTool.format(\"MMMM d, yyyy\", $date)\n## Output: March 21, 2024\n## ISO-style date format (common in feeds and APIs)\n#set ($shipDateString = \"2024-07-05\")\n#set ($shipDate = $_DateTool.toDate(\"yyyy-MM-dd\", $shipDateString))\n$_DateTool.format(\"MMM d, yyyy\", $shipDate)\n## Output: Jul 5, 2024\n## Date with time - useful for event timestamps\n#set ($stamp = \"2024-07-05 14:30:00\")\n#set ($stampDate = $_DateTool.toDate(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\", $stamp))\n$_DateTool.format(\"EEEE, MMM d 'at' h:mma\", $stampDate)\n## Output: Friday, Jul 5 at 2:30PM\nReal-world scenarios\nEvent listing with metadata dates:\n## Display event start date from page metadata\n#set ($startMillis = $currentPage.metadata.startDate)\n#if ($startMillis && $startMillis > 0)\n #set ($eventDate = $_DateTool.getDate($startMillis))\n <time datetime=\"$_DateTool.format('yyyy-MM-dd', $eventDate)\">\n $_DateTool.format(\"MMMM d, yyyy\", $eventDate)\n </time>\n#end\nNews article with published date:\n## Format last published date for byline\n#set ($pubDate = $_DateTool.getDate($currentPage.lastPublishedOn))\nPublished $_DateTool.format(\"MMM d, yyyy\", $pubDate)\nWorking with Index Blocks\nProcessing dates from Index Block XML:\n## Index Block provides timestamps in milliseconds\n#foreach ($page in $_XPathTool.selectNodes($contentRoot, \"//system-page\"))\n #set ($lastMod = $_XPathTool.selectSingleNode($page, \"last-modified-on\"))\n #set ($lastModDate = $_DateTool.getDate($lastMod.value))\n\n <li>\n $_XPathTool.selectSingleNode($page, \"title\").value\n - Updated $_DateTool.format(\"M/d/yy\", $lastModDate)\n </li>\n#end\nFiltering Index Block results by date:\n## Show only items modified in the last 30 days\n#set ($now = $_DateTool.getDate())\n#foreach ($page in $_XPathTool.selectNodes($contentRoot, \"//system-page\"))\n #set ($lastModMillis = $_XPathTool.selectSingleNode($page, \"last-modified-on\").value)\n #set ($lastModDate = $_DateTool.getDate($lastModMillis))\n #set ($diff = $_DateTool.difference($lastModDate, $now))\n\n #if ($diff.days <= 30)\n ## Display this item\n #end\n#end\nHandling edge cases\nNull-safe date handling:\n## Always check for null before formatting\n#set ($startMillis = $currentPage.metadata.startDate)\n#if ($startMillis && $startMillis > 0)\n #set ($startDate = $_DateTool.getDate($startMillis))\n $_DateTool.format(\"MMMM d, yyyy\", $startDate)\n#else\n Date not set\n#end\nPattern mismatch returns null:\n## toDate returns null if pattern doesn't match input\n#set ($input = \"March 15, 2024\")\n#set ($wrongPattern = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yyyy\", $input)) ## null\n#set ($rightPattern = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MMMM d, yyyy\", $input)) ## works\n\n#if (!$rightPattern)\n Could not parse date\n#end\nEmpty string handling:\n## Empty strings also return null\n#set ($emptyDate = \"\")\n#set ($parsed = $_DateTool.toDate(\"yyyy-MM-dd\", $emptyDate))\n\n#if (!$parsed)\n No date provided\n#end Using difference() difference() returns a Comparison object that describes the distance between two dates. When printed, it renders a human-readable value (like 5 months), and it also includes structured fields like days, months, relative, and full.\nParsing dates for comparison\nMost real-world use starts by converting a string into a Date. Keep the format string aligned with your input (this is the part that usually breaks).\n#set ($today = $_DateTool.getDate())\n\n## Example input: \"07-04-26\" (MM-dd-yy)\n#set ($manualDate = \"07-04-26\")\n#set ($targetDate = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yy\", $manualDate))\n\n$today ## Wed Jan 14 14:36:28 EST 2026\n$targetDate ## Sat Jul 04 00:00:00 EDT 2026\nBasic example: distance between two dates\nUse difference(dateA, dateB) when you want the distance between two dates. This is best for countdowns, &#8220;time since&#8221; labels, or comparisons used in logic.\n#set ($today = $_DateTool.getDate())\n#set ($manualDate = \"07-04-26\")\n#set ($targetDate = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yy\", $manualDate))\n\n## Compare today to the target date\n#set ($difference = $_DateTool.difference($today, $targetDate))\n\n$today ## Wed Jan 14 14:36:28 EST 2026\n$targetDate ## Sat Jul 04 00:00:00 EDT 2026\n$difference ## 5 months\nUseful fields on the Comparison object\nThe returned object is more than just a string. These are the fields you&#8217;ll actually use in templates and UI labels:\n$difference.abbr ## 5 mos\n$difference.difference ## 5 months\n$difference.relative ## 5 months later\n$difference.full ## 5 months 2 weeks 6 days 8 hours 23 minutes ...\n\n$difference.days ## 170\n$difference.weeks ## 24\n$difference.months ## 5\n$difference.years ## 0\n\n$difference.class ## class org.apache.velocity.tools.generic.ComparisonDateTool$Comparison\nBranching UI label: &#8220;Still coming up&#8221; vs &#8220;Happened&#8221;\nFor simple branching logic, days is the easiest field to work with. Just be consistent about argument order. In the example below, a positive number means the target date is in the future (relative to today).\n#set ($today = $_DateTool.getDate())\n#set ($manualDate = \"07-04-26\")\n#set ($targetDate = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yy\", $manualDate))\n#set ($difference = $_DateTool.difference($today, $targetDate))\n\n#if ($difference.days >= 0)\n Still coming up (in $difference.abbr)\n#else\n Happened ($difference.abbr ago)\n#end\nTip: For &#8220;ago&#8221; labels, you can also use $difference.abs() if you want a cleaner positive duration (example: 5 months instead of -5 months). whenIs() basics whenIs() answers the more human question: &#8220;When is A relative to B?&#8221; It also returns a Comparison object, but the output is naturally directional (earlier / later), which is great for client-facing labels.\nNo-arg usage: &#8220;now&#8221;\n## today is January 13, 2026 in this example\n#set ($today = $_DateTool.getDate())\n\n#set ($whenIs = $_DateTool.whenIs($today))\n$whenIs\n## now\nComparing two dates (both directions)\nArgument order matters. Swapping them flips earlier vs later.\n#set ($today = $_DateTool.getDate())\n\n#set ($manualDate = \"July 4, 2026\")\n#set ($targetDate = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MMMM dd, yyyy\", $manualDate))\n\n$targetDate\n## Sat Jul 04 00:00:00 EDT 2026\n\n## Target compared to today\n#set ($whenIsA = $_DateTool.whenIs($targetDate, $today))\n$whenIsA\n## 5 months earlier\n\n## Today compared to target\n#set ($whenIsB = $_DateTool.whenIs($today, $targetDate))\n$whenIsB\n## 5 months later\nUseful fields (same Comparison object)\nSame object structure as difference(), but the human strings are usually what you want to show clients (relative, abbr, full).\n$whenIsB.abbr ## 5 mos later\n$whenIsB.relative ## 5 months later\n$whenIsB.difference ## 5 months\n$whenIsB.full ## 5 months 3 weeks 7 hours ... later\n\n$whenIsB.days ## 171\n$whenIsB.months ## 5\n$whenIsB.years ## 0\n\n$whenIsB.class ## class org.apache.velocity.tools.generic.ComparisonDateTool$Comparison\nBranching UI label: &#8220;didn&#8217;t happen yet&#8221; vs &#8220;you missed it&#8221;\nThis is a clean pattern for client-friendly messaging. Just decide what &#8220;positive&#8221; means for your argument order and stick to it.\n#set ($today = $_DateTool.getDate())\n#set ($manualDate = \"July 4, 2026\")\n#set ($targetDate = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MMMM dd, yyyy\", $manualDate))\n\n## \"today relative to target\"\n#set ($whenIs = $_DateTool.whenIs($today, $targetDate))\n\n#if ($whenIs.days > 0)\n Didn't happen yet ($whenIs.abbr)\n#else\n You missed it ($whenIs.abbr)\n#end getCalendar basics getCalendar() returns a Java Calendar object representing the current date and time in Cascade&#8217;s configured time zone. Use it when you need to read specific parts of &#8220;now&#8221; (year, month, day, weekday, hour) as numeric values for logic.\n#set ($cal = $_DateTool.getCalendar())\n\n## Calendar field IDs (numbers) are used by:\n## $cal.get(fieldId)\n\n$cal.get(1) ## YEAR\n## Example output: 2026\n\n$cal.get(2) ## MONTH (zero-based: January = 0)\n## Example output: 0\n\n$cal.get(5) ## DAY_OF_MONTH\n## Example output: 15\n\n$cal.get(7) ## DAY_OF_WEEK (Sunday = 1 ... Saturday = 7)\n## Example output: 5\n\n$cal.get(11) ## HOUR_OF_DAY (0&#8211;23)\n## Example output: 15\nThese numeric field IDs are standard Java Calendar constants.

For date math or comparisons, use difference() or whenIs(). For formatting, use format(). Formatting output Keep your output consistent by reusing a small set of format strings. Popular options include:\n\nMMMM d, yyyy\nMMM d, yyyy\nyyyy-MM-dd\nyyyyMMdd\nEEEE, MMMM d, yyyy 'at'\n h:mma\n \nyyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssXXX (ISO 8601 with offset)\nHH:mm (24-hour) and h:mma (12-hour)\n'Week' w, yyyy (week number)\n\nCommon symbols:\nCommon date format symbols\n\n\nSymbol\nMeaning\nVariations / examples\n\n\n\n\ny\nYear\ny=2024 yy=24 yyyy=2024\n\n\nM\nMonth (1-12)\nM=8 MM=08 MMM=Aug MMMM=August\n\n\nd\nDay of month\nd=5 dd=05\n\n\nE\nDay name\nE=Wed EEE=Wed EEEE=Wednesday\n\n\nH\nHour 0-23\nH=9 HH=09\n\n\nh\nHour 1-12\nh=9 hh=09\n\n\nm\nMinute\nm=3 mm=03\n\n\ns\nSecond\ns=7 ss=07\n\n\na\nAM/PM marker\na=AM\n\n\nz\nTime zone abbreviation\nz=EDT zzzz=Eastern Daylight Time\n\n\nX\nISO 8601 offset\nX=-5 XX=-0500 XXX=-05:00\n\n\nw\nWeek of year\nw=34 ww=34\n\n\n\nPractical examples using the same timestamp:\n#set ($stamp = \"2024-08-21 13:45:00\")\n#set ($date = $_DateTool.toDate(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\", $stamp))\n\n$_DateTool.format(\"MMMM d, yyyy\", $date)\n## August 21, 2024\n\n$_DateTool.format(\"EEE, MMM d 'at' h:mma\", $date)\n## Wed, Aug 21 at 1:45PM\n\n$_DateTool.format(\"z\", $date)\n## EDT$_DateTool.format(\"zzzz\", $date)## Eastern Daylight Time Handling time zones Feeds frequently include timestamps paired with separate time zone identifiers (for example, 2024-08-21 13:00:00 with America/Chicago). If you format those dates using your server's default time zone, event times can appear hours off. To display the correct local time, you need to explicitly apply each event's time zone when formatting.\nIn most cases (all Cascade Cloud environments and most on-prem environments), you can pass a time zone string directly to $_DateTool.getTimeZone().getTimeZone():\n#set ($startDate = $currentPage.createdOn)\n\n## Default server time zone\n$_DateTool.format('EE MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy', $startDate)\n## Output: Wed Aug 21 14:08:26 EDT 2019\n\n## Converted to UTC\n$_DateTool.format('EE MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy', $startDate, $_DateTool.getLocale(), $_DateTool.getTimeZone().getTimeZone(\"UTC\"))\n## Output: Wed Aug 21 18:08:26 UTC 2019\n\n## Converted to Pacific time\n$_DateTool.format('EE MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy', $startDate, $_DateTool.getLocale(), $_DateTool.getTimeZone().getTimeZone(\"America/Los_Angeles\"))\n## Output: Wed Aug 21 11:08:26 PDT 2019\nIn some on-premise instances, this call may throw an exception like the following due to a missing JVM startup parameter:VelocityException: ASTMethod.execute() : exception invoking method 'getTimeZone' in class sun.util.calendar.ZoneInfo\nYou can verify whether your instance has this restriction by testing these two calls:\n## This works on all instances - returns a ZoneInfo object\n$_DateTool.getTimeZone()\n\n## This fails on some on-prem instances\n$_DateTool.getTimeZone().getTimeZone(\"UTC\")\nIf $_DateTool.getTimeZone().getTimeZone(\"UTC\") fails with an error, see Troubleshooting: Zone Info for the fix. You can also consider the workaround listed in the following section (\"reflection\").\nOn-premises workaround (reflection)\nThis approach uses Java reflection to access the TimeZone class directly. It can work in the event that you don't have the ability to add the JVM parameter as specified above.\n## Get the TimeZone class via reflection\n#set ($tzClass = $_DateTool.getTimeZone().getClass().forName(\"java.util.TimeZone\"))\n\n## Create a TimeZone object for UTC\n#set ($utcTz = $tzClass.getMethod(\"getTimeZone\", $tzClass.forName(\"java.lang.String\")).invoke(null, \"UTC\"))\n\n## Format a date in UTC\n$_DateTool.format('EE MMM dd HH:mm:ss z yyyy', $currentPage.createdOn, $_DateTool.getLocale(), $utcTz)\n## Output: Wed Aug 21 18:08:26 UTC 2019\nProcessing feeds with mixed time zones\nWhen processing a JSON feed where each event has its own time zone, use the reflection approach with a dynamic zone value:\n## Assume feed fields: $event.start (yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss), $event.timezone (e.g., America/Chicago)\n\n## Set up the TimeZone class reference once\n#set ($tzClass = $_DateTool.getTimeZone().getClass().forName(\"java.util.TimeZone\"))\n\n#foreach ($event in $events)\n ## Get the TimeZone for this event\n #set ($eventTz = $tzClass.getMethod(\"getTimeZone\", $tzClass.forName(\"java.lang.String\")).invoke(null, $event.timezone))\n\n ## Parse the date string\n #set ($parser = $_DateTool.getDateFormat(\"yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss\", $_DateTool.getLocale(), $eventTz))\n #set ($startDate = $parser.parse($event.start))\n\n ## Format with the event's time zone\n $_DateTool.format(\"MMM d, yyyy 'at' h:mma z\", $startDate, $_DateTool.getLocale(), $eventTz)\n ## Example output: Aug 21, 2024 at 1:00PM CDT\n#end\nValidating time zone IDs\nTime zone strings like America/Chicago or America/New_York must match Java's recognized identifiers. To see all valid IDs:\n#set ($tzClass = $_DateTool.getTimeZone().getClass().forName(\"java.util.TimeZone\"))\n#set ($allIds = $tzClass.getMethod(\"getAvailableIDs\", null).invoke(null, null))\n$_ListTool.toList($allIds)\nThis returns a list of all accepted time zone identifiers. As long as your feed's time zone values appear in this list, they will work with the examples above. Sorting by date Once you have dates, you'll often need to sort content chronologically. Cascade offers a few approaches depending on your data source.\nIndex Block sorting\nThe simplest approach is to configure sorting directly in the Index Block asset. Under the block's settings, you can sort by system properties like Last Modified Date, Created Date, or Start Date (for pages with date metadata). This handles sorting before your Velocity code runs.\nSorting with $_.query()\nThe $_.query() tool lets you query assets directly in Velocity and sort the results by date fields. Use sortBy() to specify the field and sortDirection() for ascending or descending order.\n## Query articles sorted by last modified date (newest first)\n#set ($results = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").sortBy(\"modified\").sortDirection(\"desc\").execute())\n\n#foreach ($page in $results)\n $page.name - $_DateTool.format(\"MMM d, yyyy\", $page.lastModified)\n#end\nAvailable date fields for sortBy(): created, modified, startDate, endDate, and reviewDate.\n## Sort events by start date (ascending)\n#set ($events = $_.query().byContentType(\"Event\").sortBy(\"startDate\").sortDirection(\"asc\").execute())\nSorting with $_SortTool\nWhen you need to sort a collection in Velocity, use $_SortTool. This is useful when working with structured data or when you need custom sort logic.\n## Sort a list of pages by lastModified (ascending)\n#set ($sorted = $_SortTool.sort($pages, \"lastModified\"))\n\n## Sort descending (newest first)\n#set ($sorted = $_SortTool.sort($pages, \"lastModified:desc\"))\n\n## Sort by a metadata date field\n#set ($sorted = $_SortTool.sort($pages, \"metadata.startDate:desc\"))\nSorting with XPath\nWhen processing Index Block XML, you can sort nodes directly in your XPath expression using sort-by. Date fields from Index Blocks are Unix timestamps in milliseconds, which sort numerically.\n## Sort pages by last-modified-on, newest first\n#set ($pages = $_XPathTool.selectNodes(\n $contentRoot,\n \"//system-page[sort-by(last-modified-on, 'number', 'descending')]\"\n))\n\n#foreach ($page in $pages)\n #set ($lastMod = $_XPathTool.selectSingleNode($page, \"last-modified-on\").value)\n #set ($date = $_DateTool.getDate($lastMod))\n $_DateTool.format(\"MMM d, yyyy\", $date)\n#end\nFor metadata date fields stored as timestamps, use the same numeric sort:\n## Sort by a dynamic metadata date field (e.g., event start date)\n#set ($events = $_XPathTool.selectNodes(\n $contentRoot,\n \"//system-page[sort-by(dynamic-metadata[name='start-date']/value, 'number', 'ascending')]\"\n))",

    "title": "Query Tool Directives",
    "category": "Developing In Cascade",
    "body": "Overview Introduced in Cascade CMS 8.26, Query Directives are an alternative to the .execute() method on the Query API. They process results one asset at a time instead of loading everything into a list, which means they can handle up to 100,000 results (compared to the 2,000 limit with .execute()).\nThere are three directives:\n\n#queryexecute &#8211; iterate over results and output content for each asset\n#queryfilter &#8211; apply custom filtering logic before maxResults() is applied\n#querysortvalue &#8211; define a custom sort value before maxResults() is applied\n\nAll three use the same basic pattern: pass a query object and an asset variable, write your logic in the body, and close with #end.\nTip: Use $enabledCustomDirectives to check which custom directives are available in your CMS environment. When to use directives Quick decision guide: .execute() vs directives\n\n\nScenario\nUse\n\n\n\n\nResults under 2,000 with no custom filtering or sorting\n.execute()\n\n\nNeed more than 2,000 results\n#queryexecute\n\n\nNeed to filter on values not available via built-in query methods\n#queryfilter\n\n\nNeed to sort by structured data, dynamic metadata, or computed values\n#querysortvalue\n\n\nUnder 2,000 results but need custom filtering or sorting\n#queryfilter / #querysortvalue + .execute()\n\n\nLarge dataset with custom filter + sort + output\nAll three combined #queryexecute Replaces the .execute() + #foreach pattern. The directive iterates over results directly, processing one asset at a time. Supports maxResults() up to 100,000.\nAvailable arguments for #queryexecute.\n\n\nArgument\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nquery\nSearchQueryrequired\nA query object.\n\n\nasset\nObjectrequired\nPopulated automatically by the system. Points to a new asset on each iteration, while the old asset gets cleared to save memory.\n\n\nbody\nLogicrequired\nLogic to execute and output for each asset.\n\n\n\nImportant: Unlike #foreach, this directive clears the previous asset from memory on each iteration. This means $foreach.count, $foreach.hasNext, $foreach.index, and other loop variables are not available. If you need a counter or first-iteration check, manage it yourself with a #set variable.\nBasic usage\nBuild a query, then pass it to #queryexecute instead of calling .execute().\n## Build the query (do NOT call .execute())\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").maxResults(10).sortBy(\"startDate\").sortDirection(\"desc\"))\n\n## Iterate with the directive\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <h3>$page.metadata.title</h3>\n <p>$page.metadata.summary</p>\n#end\nSitemap generation\nQuery directives are well suited for sitemaps where the result set can be very large.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Default-Page\").indexableOnly(true).preloadDynamicMetadata())\n<urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\">\n #queryexecute($query, $page)\n <url>\n <loc>https://yoursite.com${page.path}.html</loc>\n </url>\n #end\n</urlset>\nLarge datasets with preloaded data\nWhen working with structured data across many results, preload it on the query to avoid per-asset database round trips.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Event\").preloadStructuredData().maxResults(5000).sortBy(\"startDate\").sortDirection(\"asc\"))\n\n#queryexecute($query, $event)\n #set ($start = $event.getStructuredDataNode(\"startDateTime\").textValue)\n #set ($title = $event.metadata.title)\n <div class=\"event-card\">\n <h3>$title</h3>\n <span>$start</span>\n </div>\n#end\nCross-site query\nQuery across all sites for assets using a shared Content Type.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"site://Global/Shared Page\").searchAcrossAllSites().preloadDynamicMetadata().maxResults(10000))\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>\n <a href=\"${page.link}\">${page.metadata.title}</a>\n <small>(${page.siteName})</small>\n </li>\n#end\nJSON feed\nSince loop variables aren't available, use a flag variable like $isFirstIteration for comma separation in JSON output.\n#set($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Event\").preloadStructuredData().sortBy(\"startDate\"))\n#set($isFirstIteration = true)\n\n[\n#queryexecute($query, $event)\n #if(!$isFirstIteration),#end\n #set($title = $_EscapeTool.java($event.metadata.title.trim()))\n #set($date = $event.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue)\n {\n \"title\": \"${title}\",\n \"date\": \"${date}\",\n \"url\": \"[system-asset]${event.link}[/system-asset]\"\n }\n #set($isFirstIteration = false)\n#end\n]\nThe key pattern: #if(!$isFirstIteration),#end outputs a comma before every entry except the first, replacing what you'd normally do with $foreach.hasNext. #queryfilter Executes body logic on each asset matching a query before maxResults() is applied. If the body logic returns true, the asset is included in the results.\nAvailable arguments for #queryfilter.\n\n\nArgument\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nquery\nSearchQueryrequired\nA query object.\n\n\nasset\nObjectrequired\nPopulated automatically by the system. Points to a new asset on each iteration, while the old asset gets cleared to save memory.\n\n\nbody\nLogicrequired\nLogic to execute. Must return the exact string true to include the asset.\n\n\n\nNote: Built-in filtering methods result in faster performance and this directive should only be used for scenarios where there is no built-in method. For example, .bySiteName will be faster than using #queryfilter with Site name comparison logic.\nTip: You can move your logic into #queryexecute temporarily to test the functionality and ensure that your body logic returns the exact string true.\nTip: The preferred way to return a value from the filter body is to use #set to capture the result, then output it:\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n #set($result = $asset.path.contains(\"index\"))\n $result\n#end\nThis pattern handles negation and multiple conditions cleanly without needing #if/true/#end.\nFilter by path pattern\nOnly include index pages from the query results.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\"))\n\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n $asset.path.contains(\"index\")\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>${page.metadata.title}</li>\n#end\nFilter by structured data value\nInclude only assets where a structured data checkbox has a specific value. This is useful for multi-value fields where built-in methods can't filter directly.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"News\").preloadStructuredData())\n\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"details/is-featured\").textValue.contains(\"Yes\")\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <div class=\"featured-news\">\n <h3>${page.metadata.title}</h3>\n <p>${page.metadata.summary}</p>\n </div>\n#end\nFilter by dynamic metadata\nInclude only assets where a dynamic metadata field matches a condition.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Page\").preloadDynamicMetadata())\n\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n $asset.metadata.getDynamicField(\"display-in-nav\").value.contains(\"Yes\")\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li><a href=\"${page.link}\">${page.metadata.displayName}</a></li>\n#end\nFilter by empty or populated field\nUse $_PropertyTool.isNotEmpty() to include only assets where a field has a value.

The result is captured as a boolean and output directly.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").preloadStructuredData())\n\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n #set($result = $asset.path.contains(\"index\") && $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"details/is-featured\").textValue.contains(\"Yes\"))\n $result\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>${page.metadata.title}</li>\n#end\nOR logic works the same way:\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n #set($result = $asset.metadata.title.contains(\"News\") || $asset.metadata.title.contains(\"Events\"))\n $result\n#end\nExclude pattern\nTo exclude assets matching a condition, negate the check.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\"))\n\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n #set($result = !$asset.path.contains(\"/archive/\"))\n $result\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>${page.metadata.title}</li>\n#end #querysortvalue Executes body logic on each asset to determine the sort value before maxResults() is applied.

For example, .sortBy(\"name\") will be faster than using #querysortvalue with $asset.name as the logic.\nTips:\n\nThis directive sorts by string only. When sorting numbers, use $_NumberTool.withPadding to ensure results sort correctly.\nThis directive respects the value passed into .sortDirection() on the query.\n\n\nSort by metadata title\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\"))\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n $asset.metadata.title\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>${page.metadata.title}</li>\n#end\nSort by structured data text field\nSort by a text value stored in structured data rather than a metadata field.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").preloadStructuredData().sortDirection(\"asc\"))\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"title\").textValue\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>${page.getStructuredDataNode(\"title\").textValue}</li>\n#end\nNumeric sorting with $_NumberTool.withPadding\nSince #querysortvalue sorts by string, numeric values need padding to sort correctly (e.g., \"5\" would sort after \"10\" without padding).\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Course\").preloadStructuredData().sortDirection(\"asc\"))\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n $_NumberTool.withPadding($asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"course-number\").textValue)\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $course)\n <li>${course.getStructuredDataNode(\"course-number\").textValue} - ${course.metadata.title}</li>\n#end\nMulti-level sorting\nSince sorting is string-based, you can concatenate multiple values to sort by more than one field. The first value acts as the primary sort, the second as the tiebreaker, and so on.\nAlphabetical by last name, then first name\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Staff\").preloadStructuredData().sortDirection(\"asc\"))\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"last-name\").textValue $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"first-name\").textValue\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $person)\n <li>${person.getStructuredDataNode(\"last-name\").textValue}, ${person.getStructuredDataNode(\"first-name\").textValue}</li>\n#end\nBy department number, then course name\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Course\").preloadStructuredData().sortDirection(\"asc\"))\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n $_NumberTool.withPadding($asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"department-number\").textValue) $asset.metadata.title\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $course)\n <li>${course.getStructuredDataNode(\"department-number\").textValue} - ${course.metadata.title}</li>\n#end\nNote the $_NumberTool.withPadding on the department number. Without it, department \"5\" would sort after \"10\" since it's comparing strings.\nBy author, then title\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").sortDirection(\"asc\").maxResults(50))\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n $asset.metadata.author $asset.metadata.title\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>${page.metadata.author} &mdash; ${page.metadata.title}</li>\n#end\nSort by date stored in structured data\nDate strings like 01-15-2024 02:30:00 PM won't sort chronologically as plain strings because the month comes first. Convert the value to epoch milliseconds with $_DateTool so the sort is truly chronological.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Event\").preloadStructuredData().sortDirection(\"desc\").maxResults(20))\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n #set ($dt = $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue)\n #if($_PropertyTool.isNotEmpty($dt))\n #set ($date = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss a\", $dt))\n ${date.getTime()}\n #else\n 0\n #end\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $event)\n <li>\n ${event.metadata.title}\n <span>${event.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue}</span>\n </li>\n#end\nThe format string passed to $_DateTool.toDate() must match the format stored in your data definition. Adjust it to match your field's format.\nSort descending\nThe directive respects .sortDirection(). Set it on the query object before using #querysortvalue.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"News\").sortDirection(\"desc\"))\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n $asset.metadata.title\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>${page.metadata.title}</li>\n#end Combining directives All three directives can be used together on the same query. The order of operations is: #queryfilter runs first to narrow the results, then #querysortvalue determines the sort order, and finally #queryexecute outputs the results up to the maxResults() limit.\nFull example: filtered, sorted event listing\nQuery all events, filter to only featured ones, sort by a structured data date field, and output the first 50.\n## Build the query\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Event\").preloadStructuredData().sortDirection(\"asc\").maxResults(50))\n\n## Filter: only featured events\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"is-featured\").textValue.contains(\"Yes\")\n#end\n\n## Sort: by event date stored in structured data\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue\n#end\n\n## Output\n<ul>\n#queryexecute($query, $event)\n <li>\n <strong>${event.metadata.title}</strong>\n <span>${event.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue}</span>\n </li>\n#end\n</ul>\nDate range filter with chronological sorting\nFilter to events within a specific date range and sort them chronologically. The filter parses each date into epoch milliseconds for comparison, and the sort does the same for ordering.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Event\").preloadStructuredData().sortDirection(\"asc\").maxResults(100))\n#set ($rangeStart = $_DateTool.toDate(\"yyyy-MM-dd\", \"2024-01-01\").getTime())\n#set ($rangeEnd = $_DateTool.toDate(\"yyyy-MM-dd\", \"2024-12-31\").getTime())\n\n## Filter: only events in 2024\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n #set ($dt = $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue)\n #if($_PropertyTool.isNotEmpty($dt))\n #set ($ts = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss a\", $dt).getTime())\n #if($ts >= $rangeStart && $ts <= $rangeEnd)\n true\n #end\n #end\n#end\n\n## Sort: chronological by event date\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n #set ($dt = $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue)\n #if($_PropertyTool.isNotEmpty($dt))\n #set ($date = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss a\", $dt))\n ${date.getTime()}\n #else\n 0\n #end\n#end\n\n## Output with formatted date\n#queryexecute($query, $event)\n #set ($dt = $event.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue)\n #set ($date = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss a\", $dt))\n #set ($formatted = $_DateTool.format(\"MMMM d, yyyy\", $date))\n <li>\n <strong>${event.metadata.title}</strong>\n <span>$formatted</span>\n </li>\n#end In-depth examples These examples demonstrate advanced patterns that build on the basics above. They reference a Content Type with the following fields. Adapt the content type path and field names to match your own setup.\n\nStructured data: title (text), event-date (datetime in MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss a format), asset-chooser (page chooser)\nDynamic metadata: multiselect (multi-select), checkbox (checkbox), department (dropdown), radio (radio), noindex (radio)\nStandard metadata: title, author, displayName, summary, description, teaser, keywords, startDate, endDate\n\nFiltering\n Filter by all values in a multi-select field\n\nCheck that a multi-value field contains every expected value using multiple .contains() calls joined with &&.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").preloadDynamicMetadata().maxResults(-1))\n\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n #set ($cb = $asset.metadata.getDynamicField(\"checkbox\").value)\n #set($result = $cb.contains(\"Easy\") && $cb.contains(\"Fast\") && $cb.contains(\"Cheap\"))\n $result\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>${page.metadata.title}</li>\n#end\n\n Combine structured data, dynamic metadata, and standard metadata\n\nFilter using fields from three different sources in one condition. Preload both structured data and dynamic metadata on the query.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").preloadStructuredData().preloadDynamicMetadata().maxResults(-1))\n\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n #set($result = $_PropertyTool.isNotEmpty($asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue) && $asset.metadata.getDynamicField(\"checkbox\").value.contains(\"Easy\") && $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"title\").textValue.contains(\"Guide\"))\n $result\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>${page.getStructuredDataNode(\"title\").textValue}</li>\n#end\n\n\nSorting\n Sort by field value, then by date chronologically\n\nConcatenate a text field with epoch milliseconds for a two-level sort. The text field acts as the primary sort, and the date as the tiebreaker.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Event\").preloadStructuredData().preloadDynamicMetadata().sortDirection(\"asc\").maxResults(30))\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n #set ($group = $asset.metadata.getDynamicField(\"department\").value)\n #set ($dt = $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue)\n #if($_PropertyTool.isNotEmpty($dt))\n #set ($date = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss a\", $dt))\n ${group} ${date.getTime()}\n #else\n ${group} 0\n #end\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>${page.metadata.getDynamicField(\"department\").value} &mdash; ${page.metadata.title}</li>\n#end\n\n\nCombined\n Most recent pages in a filtered category\n\nCombine #queryfilter to narrow by category, #querysortvalue to sort by date descending, and maxResults(10) to take only the top 10.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").preloadStructuredData().sortDirection(\"desc\").maxResults(10))\n\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n $asset.metadata.title.contains(\"Science\")\n#end\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n #set ($dt = $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue)\n #if($_PropertyTool.isNotEmpty($dt))\n #set ($date = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss a\", $dt))\n ${date.getTime()}\n #else\n 0\n #end\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>${page.metadata.title}</li>\n#end\n\n Three-field filter with two-field sort\n\nFilter on three conditions (dynamic metadata + standard metadata), then sort by two concatenated fields.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").preloadStructuredData().preloadDynamicMetadata().sortDirection(\"asc\").maxResults(25))\n\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n #set($result = $asset.metadata.getDynamicField(\"checkbox\").value.contains(\"Fast\") && $asset.metadata.getDynamicField(\"noindex\").value.contains(\"No\") && $_PropertyTool.isNotEmpty($asset.metadata.summary))\n $result\n#end\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n $asset.metadata.getDynamicField(\"department\").value $asset.metadata.author\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <li>\n ${page.metadata.getDynamicField(\"department\").value} &mdash;\n ${page.metadata.author} &mdash;\n ${page.metadata.title}\n </li>\n#end\n\n Group results under dynamic headers\n\nSort by the grouping field so identical values are adjacent, then detect when the value changes to insert a header.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").preloadDynamicMetadata().sortDirection(\"asc\").maxResults(50))\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n $asset.metadata.getDynamicField(\"department\").value $asset.metadata.title\n#end\n\n#set ($currentGroup = \"\")\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n #set ($group = $page.metadata.getDynamicField(\"department\").value)\n #if($group != $currentGroup)\n <h3>$group</h3>\n #set ($currentGroup = $group)\n #end\n <li>${page.metadata.title}</li>\n#end\n\n\nAdvanced patterns\n Aggregate counts by field value\n\nUse a map to count how many pages have each value in a field. Arithmetic (+) only works inside #set directives, not inside method arguments like .put().\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").preloadDynamicMetadata().maxResults(-1))\n#set ($counts = {\"Yes\": 0, \"No\": 0, \"Maybe\": 0})\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n #set ($val = $page.metadata.getDynamicField(\"radio\").value)\n #if($val.contains(\"Yes\"))\n #set ($n = $counts.get(\"Yes\") + 1)\n #set ($dummy = $counts.put(\"Yes\", $n))\n #elseif($val.contains(\"No\"))\n #set ($n = $counts.get(\"No\") + 1)\n #set ($dummy = $counts.put(\"No\", $n))\n #elseif($val.contains(\"Maybe\"))\n #set ($n = $counts.get(\"Maybe\") + 1)\n #set ($dummy = $counts.put(\"Maybe\", $n))\n #end\n#end\nYes: $counts.get(\"Yes\"), No: $counts.get(\"No\"), Maybe: $counts.get(\"Maybe\")\n\n Parse, sort, and format dates for display\n\nFilter to pages with a date, sort chronologically using epoch milliseconds, then format the date for readable output with $_DateTool.format().\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Event\").preloadStructuredData().sortDirection(\"desc\").maxResults(15))\n\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n $_PropertyTool.isNotEmpty($asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue)\n#end\n\n#querysortvalue($query, $asset)\n #set ($dt = $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue)\n #set ($date = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss a\", $dt))\n ${date.getTime()}\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $event)\n #set ($dt = $event.getStructuredDataNode(\"event-date\").textValue)\n #set ($date = $_DateTool.toDate(\"MM-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss a\", $dt))\n #set ($formatted = $_DateTool.format(\"MMMM d, yyyy\", $date))\n <li>\n <strong>${event.metadata.title}</strong>\n <span>$formatted</span>\n </li>\n#end\n\n Count pages per category using a map\n\nDefine a map of categories with initial counts of zero. Iterate all pages, check each category, and increment the count. Output the breakdown with #foreach on the map entries.\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").maxResults(-1))\n#set ($cats = {\"Technology\": 0, \"Science\": 0, \"Education\": 0, \"Healthcare\": 0, \"Business\": 0})\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n #set ($t = $page.metadata.title)\n #foreach($cat in $cats.keySet())\n #if($t.contains($cat))\n #set ($n = $cats.get($cat) + 1)\n #set ($dummy = $cats.put($cat, $n))\n #end\n #end\n#end\n\n<ul>\n#foreach($entry in $cats.entrySet())\n <li>$entry.key: $entry.value</li>\n#end\n</ul> Migration guide Converting an existing .execute() pattern to use directives is straightforward.\nBefore: .execute() + #foreach\n#set ($results = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").maxResults(10).sortBy(\"startDate\").sortDirection(\"desc\").execute())\n\n#foreach ($page in $results)\n <h3>$page.metadata.title</h3>\n <p>$page.metadata.summary</p>\n#end\nAfter: #queryexecute\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"Article\").maxResults(10).sortBy(\"startDate\").sortDirection(\"desc\"))\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <h3>$page.metadata.title</h3>\n <p>$page.metadata.summary</p>\n#end\nKey changes:\n\nRemove .execute() from the query chain.\nReplace #foreach ($page in $results) with #queryexecute($query, $page).\nThe body stays the same.\n\nBefore: .execute() with manual filtering\n#set ($list = $_.query().byContentType(\"News\").preloadStructuredData().execute())\n\n#foreach ($page in $list)\n #if ($page.getStructuredDataNode(\"details/is-featured\").textValue.contains(\"Yes\"))\n <div>$page.metadata.title</div>\n #end\n#end\nAfter: #queryfilter + #queryexecute\n#set ($query = $_.query().byContentType(\"News\").preloadStructuredData())\n\n#queryfilter($query, $asset)\n $asset.getStructuredDataNode(\"details/is-featured\").textValue.contains(\"Yes\")\n#end\n\n#queryexecute($query, $page)\n <div>$page.metadata.title</div>\n#end\nKey changes:\n\nRemove .execute() and the #foreach/#if block.\nMove the condition into #queryfilter. The body must return the exact string true.\nUse #queryexecute for the output, now with only matching results.\n\nTip: With #queryfilter, the filtering happens before maxResults() is applied. This means you get the correct number of matching results, rather than filtering down from a potentially truncated list.",

    "body": "Working with choosers When working with choosers, it is important to save repeated .asset calls to a variable and then access that variable's methods directly. Failure to do so will result in multiple round trips to the database when only a single round trip is necessary.\nConsider the following Velocity code which accesses an image file that has been selected in a chooser: \n#set ($image = $currentPage.getStructuredDataNode(\"image\"))## one database round trip#set ($imageLink = $image.asset.link)## another database round trip#set ($imageFileSize = $image.asset.fileSize) ## another database round trip#set ($imageWidth = $image.asset.dimensions.width)## another database round trip#set ($imageHeight = $image.asset.dimensions.height) \nAs indicated by the comments, each line with .asset is having to fetch the image from the database (forcing a round trip from the app to the database and back). \nRather than doing this, the code can be simplified by saving the chosen asset to a variable and then accessing methods of that variable:\n## one database round trip#set ($selectedImage = $currentPage.getStructuredDataNode(\"image\").asset) #set ($imageLink =$selectedImage.link) #set ($imageFileSize = $selectedImage.fileSize)#set ($imageWidth = $selectedImage.dimensions.width)#set ($imageHeight = $selectedImage.dimensions.height) Importing Formats #import directives in Formats require a round trip from the app to the database and back again. This is necessary in order for the app to retrieve the contents of the Format being imported at runtime. Due to this fact, it is important to limit the number of #import directives as much as possible in order to keep transformation times performant. \nConsider the following sample code snippet below which imports 3 Formats. Each of the imported Formats contains a single macro.\n## one database round trip#import (\"_cms/formats/shared/macros/stripTags\")## another database round trip#import (\"_cms/formats/shared/macros/escapeAll\")## another database round trip#import (\"_cms/formats/shared/macros/makeAccessible\")\nWhile this type of setup is clean and makes things very straightforward to manage (a single Format contains a single macro with a corresponding name), it requires 3 round trips to the database during the transformation of any Page on which the main Format is attached.\nIn order to prevent repeated #import calls like this, macros should instead be combined into fewer Formats so that fewer #import directives are needed.\nContinuing the example from above, the macros from the 3 separate Formats indicated above can be combined into a single Format (we'll name it utility for the purposes of this sample). Then, rather than importing 3 separate Formats to get access to the 3 individual macros, a single line will do the trick:\n## one database round trip#import (\"_cms/formats/shared/macros/utility\")\nNow, rather than making multiple trips back and forth to the database (adding to overall render times), only one trip is required and the main Format automatically has access to all of the macros needed for the transformation. Using the Query API Accessing Structured Data and Dynamic Metadata\nWhen working with the Query API, if you're accessing Structured Data or Dynamic Metadata fields for the queried assets, you should utilize the corresponding $_.query().preloadStructuredData and/or $_.query().preloadDynamicMetadata methods for a performance boost. \nPreloading Structured Data\nConsider the following code which loads 500 \"events\":\n#set ($events = $_.query().byContentType(\"event\").execute())#foreach ($event in $events) ## database round trip (x 500) #set($start = $event.getStructuredDataNode(\"startDateTime\").textValue) #set($end = $event.getStructuredDataNode(\"endDateTime\").textValue) #set($details = $event.getStructuredDataNode(\"details\").textValue) #set($link = $event.getStructuredDataNode(\"additional\").getChild(\"link\").textValue)## additional logic here#end\nIn the foreach loop here, the application will be required to make a database round trip for each of the 500 results in order to gather each asset's Structured Data. \nBy adding the \"preload\" method to the query as seen below:\n#set ($events = $_.query().byContentType(\"event\").preloadStructuredData().execute())\nThe initial query execution will take longer (since the application is gathering the related Structured Data for all 500 results upfront), but accessing this data in the foreach loop for each asset will be exponentially faster as the data is already in memory. \nPreloading Dynamic Metadata\nSimilar to above, you can preload dynamic metadata as well. Consider the following code in a scenario where the query is returning 500 assets:\n#set ($events = $_.query().byContentType(\"event\").execute())#foreach ($event in $events) ## database round trip (x 500) #set($showInNavMenu = $event.metadata.getDynamicField(\"display-in-nav\").value) #set($alternateTitle = $event.metadata.getDynamicField(\"alternate title\").value)## additional logic here #end\nIn order to increase performance, we can change the query line as follows which will preload the necessary dynamic metadata fields:\n#set ($events = $_.query().byContentType(\"event\").preloadDynamicMetadata().execute())\nThis will force the app to load all of the metadata fields upfront which prevents the repeated database round trips within the foreach loop.\nLeveraging the #queryexecute directive\nThe #queryexecute directive is an alternative to the .execute() method of the Query API. The main benefits of using this directive are as follows:\n\nIt bypasses the 2,000 asset limitation of the .execute() method (allowing for querying up to 100,000 assets).\nOn each iteration, the previous asset in stored in memory is removed from memory to allow for the processing of the remaining assets without hampering performance.",

Cascade CMS 8.8 Siteimprove Settings\nThe siteImproveUrl property has been added to the site complexType which can be used to overwrite the Site URL if it differs from the URL specified within Siteimprove.\nSystem Dictionary\nA new ability, modifyDictionary, has been added to the global-abilities complexType to match new abilities available in the UI related to allowing users the ability to modify the System Dictionary. Cascade CMS 8.7 Asset Naming Rules\nThe following properties have been added to site asset:\n\ninheritNamingRules\nnamingRuleCase\nnamingRuleSpacing\nnamingRuleAssets\n\nScheduling properties\nProperties reviewOnSchedule and reviewEvery belong now to dublin-aware-asset rather than folder-contained-asset. This means that references, formats and templates no longer have these properties.\nMove/rename workflow type\nThe workflowDefinition asset has a new boolean property: move. Cascade CMS 8.6 Extensions to Strip\nThe extensionsToStrip property has been added to the destination and site complexTypes which can be used to remove extension(s) from links managed by Cascade CMS during publish.\nLDAP Users\nThe ldapDN property has been added to the user compexType which can be used to update an existing LDAP User's binding DN, or manually create new LDAP Users using Web Services. Cascade CMS 8.5 Metadata Field Help Text\nMetadata help text fields are now available for read/edit via web services to match the UI. Fields authorFieldHelpText, descriptionFieldHelpText, displayNameFieldHelpText, endDateFieldHelpText, expirationFolderFieldHelpText, keywordsFieldHelpText, reviewDateFieldHelpText, startDateFieldHelpText, summaryFieldHelpText, teaserFieldHelpText, and titleFieldHelpText have been added to the metadataSet complexType and field helpText has been added to thedynamicMetadataFieldDefinition complexType to facilitate reading/editing help text.\nScheduled Asset Review\nConfiguring scheduled asset reviews is now available via web services. The reviewOnSchedule and reviewEvery properties have been added to the folder-contained-asset complexType which can be used to enable and configure the scheduling of reviews on home area assets. Cascade CMS 8.4.1.2ccc4d6 In 8.4.1.2ccc4d6, it is possible to configure whether or not folders should be included in the Stale Content Report. This setting is available at a folder level through the \"includeInStaleContent\" property:\n <element name=\"includeInStaleContent\" maxoccurs=\"1\" minoccurs=\"0\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:boolean\"></element> Cascade CMS 8.3 WYSIWYG Editor Configurations\nCustomizable WYSIWYG Configurations, added in Cascade 8.3, can be manipulated via web services operations like most other assets in the system. The available fields are displayed below:\n<complexType name=\"editorConfiguration\"> <complexContent> <extension base=\"impl:named-asset\"> <sequence> <!-- The Site in which the asset is located NOT REQUIRED when referencing the System Default Editor Configuration (id=DEFAULT, name=Default) One is REQUIRED for all other Editor Configurations --> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"0\" name=\"siteId\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\"></element> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"0\" name=\"siteName\" nillable=\"true\" type=\"xsd:string\"></element> <!-- File containing css for the WYSIWYG editor Priority: cssFileId > cssFilePath NOT REQUIRED --> <!-- When editing and selected asset is recycled, it is recommended to preserve this relationship by providing selected asset's id in case if the selected asset gets restored from the recycle bin. --> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"0\" name=\"cssFileId\" type=\"xsd:string\"></element> <!-- Path works only for non-recycled assets --> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"0\" name=\"cssFilePath\" type=\"xsd:string\"></element> <!-- NOT REQUIRED: For reading purposes only. Ignored when editing, copying etc. --> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"0\" name=\"cssFileRecycled\" type=\"xsd:boolean\"></element> <!-- JSON String for the configuration --> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"1\" name=\"configuration\" nillable=\"false\" type=\"xsd:string\"></element> </sequence> </extension> </complexContent></complexType>\nA listEditorConfigurations operation has also been added which allows script writers to access all Wysiwyg Editor Configurations contained in a particular Site.\nWith the addition of WYSIWYG configurations, all WYSIWYG related properties on Groups and Sites have been removed. Sites and Content Types have new properties defaultEditorConfigurationId/defaultEditorConfigurationPath and editorConfigurationId/editorConfigurationPath respectively, which allow editor configurations to be assigned to those asset types via web services.\nNew abilities accessEditorConfigurations and bypassWysiwygEditorRestrictions have been added to the sites-abilities complexType and the accessDefaultEditorConfiguration ability has been added to global-abilities to match new abilities available in the UI related to WYSIWYG configurations.\nGlobal Area Cleanup and Other Misc Updates\nIn an effort to clean up remnants of the Global Area, most of the old Global Area abilities on Roles that are no longer applicable have been removed from the global-abilities complexType.\nThe defaultGroup property has also been removed from User objects as it has been removed from the system entirely.\nThe accessAudits ability has been added to the global-abilities complexType to match the UI. Cascade CMS 8.1.1 Fixed: Blocks can not be read if underlying Data Definition has a field added to it Cascade CMS 8.1 Search Updates\nThe Web Services search API has been updated to mirror the new Advanced Search UI added in Cascade 8.0. \nIt's now possible to filter search results by specific types, specific fields, and/or a specific site. Search terms behave identically to how they behave in the UI. Multi-word phrases can be searched for by surrounding the terms in double-quotes. Unquoted terms will be matched individually. For example, \"mouse rat\" will exactly match the phrase \"mouse rat\", but mouse rat will match mouse or rat or both.\nNote that single term searches in 8.1 will also include partial word matches. So, searching for housewill match milhouse and houseboat. This did not happen in 8.0.x.\nThe \"searchInformation\" complexType has been changed to the following which more closely matches the new Advanced Search UI:\n<complexType name=\"searchInformation\">\n <sequence> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"1\" name=\"searchTerms\" type=\"xsd:string\"></element> <!-- Id or name of the site to searchNOT REQUIRED, if left blank, all sites will be searched --> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"0\" name=\"siteId\" nillable=\"false\" type=\"xsd:string\"></element> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"0\" name=\"siteName\" nillable=\"false\" type=\"xsd:string\"></element> <!-- Asset fields to search (e.g. name, title, content), see searchField simpleType for valid values NOT REQUIRED --> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"0\" name=\"searchFields\" nillable=\"false\" type=\"impl:searchFields\"></element> <!-- Asset types to search (e.g. page, folder, site) NOT REQUIRED, if left blank, all asset types will be searched --> <element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"0\" name=\"searchTypes\" nillable=\"false\" type=\"impl:searchTypes\"></element> </sequence></complexType>\nNotice the elements to specify a site by either id or name, the element to specify the types of assets to match, and the element to specify the fields to match.\nThe searchTypes element can be populated with any of the values that already exist in the entityTypeString simpleType.\nThe searchFields element can be populated with any values present in the newly addedsearchFieldString simpleType displayed below.\n<simpleType name=\"searchFieldString\"> <restriction base=\"xsd:string\"> <!-- Basic fields --> <enumeration value=\"name\"/> <enumeration value=\"path\"/> <enumeration value=\"createdBy\"/> <enumeration value=\"modifiedBy\"/> <!-- Metadata fields --> <enumeration value=\"displayName\"/> <enumeration value=\"title\"/> <enumeration value=\"summary\"/> <enumeration value=\"teaser\"/> <enumeration value=\"keywords\"/> <enumeration value=\"description\"/> <enumeration value=\"author\"/> <!-- File content --> <enumeration value=\"blob\"/> <!-- Velocity Format content --> <enumeration value=\"velocityFormatContent\"/> <!-- WYSIWYG and Data Definition Page content, Text and XML Block content, Template content, XSLT Format content --> <enumeration value=\"xml\"/> <!-- Symlink link text field --> <enumeration value=\"link\"/> </restriction></simpleType> Cascade CMS 8.0 Asset Factory Descriptions\nWith the addition of the \"description\" field for Asset Factories and Asset Factory Containers in the UI, the WSDL has been updated to allow configuring that field via web services.\n<element maxOccurs=\"1\" minOccurs=\"0\" name=\"description\" type=\"xsd:string\"></element>\nGoodbye Global!\nWith the removal of the Global Area from the system, all existing complexTypes containing a siteName and siteId now require that at least one of those fields be populated. This includes all home area assets and site management components. Note that this is not enforced in the WSDL but is enforced by the server whenever an edit or create operation is performed.\nAbility Updates\nThe existing \"accessAdminArea\" global ability has been renamed to \"accessManageSiteArea\" and a new ability with the old name, \"accessAdminArea\", has been added which governs access to the new System Administration area and not the Manage Site area as the renamed ability does.\nThe New Site wizard and Site Migration wizard tools have been removed from the system and their corresponding global abilities in the WSDL, \"newSiteWizard\" and \"siteMigration\", have also been removed.\nThe Recycle Bin Checker and Path Repair database tools have also been removed from the system and their global abilities, \"recycleBinChecker\" and \"pathRepairTool\", have likewise been removed from the WSDL.\nSearch Updates\nSearch via the UI has been revamped; however, the WSDL has not yet been updated to be compatible with the new search functionality. Searching via web services will be unpredictable at best and will outright fail at worst. Stay tuned for search updates in a future release!

    "title": "SOAP Web Services Operations",
    "category": "Developing In Cascade",
    "body": "Introduction to Web Services Operations When looking through the WSDL, you can find all of the operations available along with their responses at the top. Every operation is represented by an <element> block with the corresponding name for the operation; the response is simply the name of the operation with a \"Response\" suffix.\nThe responses contain an \"operationResult\", which is described by the following complexType in the WSDL: This WSDL describes that inside the corresponding element (i.e. \"editReturn\") will appear two more elements: \"success\", which will be either \"true\" or \"false\", and a \"message\" element that will contain a relevant message from the server (generally only non-nill when the operation failed). Authentication For each operation, it is necessary to include authentication information. This is specified by the required \"authentication\" element seen in every request type. Looking further in the WSDL, we see the following: This complex type corresponds to this authentication element. The authentication type must contain one of: username and password OR apiKey, which are each of the type String. This is used by Cascade CMS to authenticate the user making the SOAP request and to ensure that the user has the proper permissions to carry out that operation.\nExample: Operation Overview Creating and Editing are two very similar operations. Looking at the WSDL, we see both the \"create\" and \"edit\" operations take two sub-elements: authentication (discussed above) and asset. Asset is a universal classification for all Cascade CMS assets and for including workflow information (when necessary). Looking at the \"asset\" complexType , we see the following: First, there is the workflowConfiguration element. This is necessary when the user executing the SOAP request does not have the required permissions to bypass workflow, and the operation is subject to workflow. For more information about workflow and SOAP, please see Workflow and Web Services Operations.\nNext, there is the choice element that specifies that the user has a choice between all these assets, and each one corresponds to a specific asset type in Cascade CMS. Note that due to the choice element wrapping these elements and the maxOccurs=\"1\" and minOccurs=\"1\" attributes, only one asset may be specified at a time. If you wish to do bulk creation/editing, see the Batch Operation. Read Operation All read operations conform to the following WSDL: Authentication has been discussed before, in the Authentication section.\nThe identifier complex type is defined in the following WSDL: An identifier is a composite type used to identify a single asset in Cascade CMS. It melds an ID or Path, and a type.\nWhen using a Path as an identifer, you must use a Path type, which is a string of the path, and a Site name or Site ID: The type is defined by the following enumeration: Delete Operation The delete operation is just like the read operation in that it contains an identifier. The WSDL describing the delete operation is as follows: The delete operation contains workflow information and an identifier, which are discussed in the Workflow and Web Services Operations and Read Operation sections, respectively. Move Operation The move operation is just like the delete operation in that it contains an identifier. The WSDL describing the move operation is as follows: The move operation contains workflow information and an identifier, which are discussed in the Workflow and Web Services Operations and Read Operation sections, respectively. Publish Operation The publish operation is very similar to the read and delete operation: This time the publish operation only takes an identifier and no workflow information. The identifier must reference only publishable assets: a file, folder, or page. Also, it is possible to specify a target, destination, or publish set by using the types target, destination, or publishset in the identifier. The user included in the authentication information must be of the publisher role or higher; otherwise they will not be able to publish and receive an response indicating a failure. Batch Operation The batch operation is a simple way of accomplishing multiple operations while only transmitting a single SOAP request/response. Here is the WSDL for the \"batch\" element: Authentication has already been discussed; what is important here is the ability to specify any number of \"operation\" elements, each of which map to the \"operation\" complex type: The operation complex type is simply an aggregate of all the other operation types available.\nHere is a sample batch request: This batch request edits the /intranet/default page and then publishes those changes. Workflow and Web Services Operations When a user making an edit, create, or delete request does not have the role/permission to bypass workflow, it is necessary to include workflow information in the request message. This complex type allows the user to specify what to name the workflow instance and what workflow definition to use when instantiating workflow. Additionally, the user must provide workflow comments explaining the action and any workflow step configuration.\nConfiguring the Workflow Steps\nThe workflowStepConfigurations element corresponds to the following workflow-step-configurations complex type: This complex type is just a list of workflowStepConfiguration elements which correspond to workflow-step-configuration complex types: This allows the user to re-assign workflow steps with a given identifier (using the stepIdentifier element) to a given user or group (using the stepAssignment element). If no workflow step configurations are supplied, the workflow will be initialized with the default values for each step. If no default values are specified in the workflow definition, the user will receive an error explaining that the workflow's steps must be configured.\nTransitioning Between Workflow Steps\nWorkflow steps can be transistions with web services using the performWorkflowTransition call. This call requires the workflowTransitionInformation complex type: Search Operation The search operation is defined by the following WSDL: This operation contains authentication information and searchInformation.\nThe searchInformation complex type, and related types, are defined as follows: This searchInformation complex type, and related types, contain all the fields that one would find in the Advanced Search screen from within the Cascade CMS web interface.\nWhen executing a search, Cascade CMS will return a Search Result object: This complex type contains a type called \"search-matches\", which is an array of identifiers: Authenticate Operation The authenticate operation relies on the same authentication type the other Asset Operations use: This authentication object contains username, password and apiKey elements; all of which are of type String. Either username and password OR apiKey are required.\nNote - The Authenticate Operation is implemented in the Security Service, which is a different Cascade CMS Web Services Endpoint than the Endpoint used to accomplish the other operations (Asset Operation Handler). Make sure that when you are sending a request containing this operation that you are sending it to the correct endpoint (Security Service).",

It can be used for paths or blocks of code that need to be present upon publishing, but not necessarily when viewed within Cascade CMS.\n[system-view:external]This appears outside Cascade.[/system-view:external]\nExamples:\n\nWrap around web analytics JavaScript so it only tracks traffic on the published page.\nWrap around server-side includes, since they'll only work outside of Cascade CMS. System CDATA XML's CDATA section instructs the XML parser to ignore whatever content is inside of it. This results in the content being treated strictly as character data instead of markup.\n[cascade:cdata]content[/cascade:cdata]\nIn the following example: the < and & characters, if not wrapped in a CDATA section, would generate a parser error because they indicate the start of an element and the start of a character entity respectively. When applying formats to page content, CDATA sections in the content are often interpreted and then removed from the resulting XML. The Cascade CMS CDATA tags are used to ensure that the CDATA section makes it into the page content that is output when rendered inside the system and when published.This is useful when generating RSS feeds, for example, as the feed itself should contain CDATA sections to instruct the feed readers to interpret the content within the sections as character data.",

This can often happen in alternative text attributes.\nTo address this, navigate to the Format specified in the error message, and escape any variables that may contain problematic content such as titles or alternative text. For example, if you're outputting an image tag with:\n<img src=\"${path}\" alt=\"${alt}\"/>\nYou can escape your alternative text attribute using the $_EscapeTool:\n<img src=\"${path}\" alt=\"${_EscapeTool.xml($alt)}\"/>\nThis will ensure any problematic characters like & are escaped as &amp;.\nThe entity name must immediately follow the '&' in the entity reference. / The reference to entity \"...\" must end with the ';' delimiter.\nExamples:\nAn error occurred: com.hannonhill.cascade.model.render.page.PageRenderException: Could not transform with Script format \"path/to/format\": Error on line ##: The entity name must immediately follow the '&' in the entity reference.\nAn error occurred: com.hannonhill.cascade.model.render.page.PageRenderException: Could not transform with Script format \"path/to/format\": Error on line ##: The reference to entity \"...\" must end with the ';' delimiter.\nThese usually indicate that an ampersand (&) character in a variable isn't being properly escaped in the Format listed in the error message.\nTo address this, navigate to the Format specified in the error message, and escape any variables that may contain non-XML-friendly content such as titles, descriptions, or links that may contain URL parameters.\nFor example, if you're outputting a title variable with:\n<h1>$title</h1>\nEscape the content using something like the $_EscapeTool:\n<h1>${_EscapeTool.xml($title)}</h1>\nThis will ensure any invalid characters such as & are escaped as &amp;.\nThe requested asset does not exist: Format #import with path 'path/to/imported/format'\nExample:\nAn error occurred: com.hannonhill.cascade.model.render.page.PageRenderException: Could not transform with Script format \"path/to/format\": com.hannonhill.cascade.exception.AssetNotFoundException: The requested asset does not exist: Format #import with path 'path/to/imported/format'\nThis indicates that the Format specified in the first half of the error message is importing another Format that doesn't exist at the path listed in the second half of the message.\nCheck the Format specified in the error message to ensure that the imported Format exists and that the path called out (ex. #import 'path/to/format') is correct.",

    "body": "When attempting to perform an operation that relies on SSL/TLS, you may see errors like the following:\njava.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException: Error constructing implementation (algorithm: Default, provider: SunJSSE, class: sun.security.ssl.SSLContextImpl$DefaultSSLContext)\nThis is generally due to the system not being able to locate a valid certificate for the application server. There are a few areas of the system to check when troubleshooting this particular issue: Cascade CMS 8.21 and newer To locate the keystore settings for the application:\n\nGo to System Preferences\nIn the System tab, scroll down to the SSL/TLS Key Store section.\nVerify that:\n\nThe Key Store Path points to a valid key store on the application server.\nThe key store referenced in the Key Store Path field contains the proper SSL certificates for the application server itself.\nThe Key Store Password field contains the correct password for the key store that is being referenced.\n\n\nAny changes made will require restarting Cascade CMS\n\nNote: If using the bundled keystore in the Cascade CMS installation, the default password is changeit Prior to Cascade CMS 8.21 While it may not seem related at first, the LDAP Configuration in your instance can potentially be the cause of this problem. If you happen to be using LDAP to sync/authenticate users in your instance, check the following items in your configuration:\n\nIn the Binding section, see if the SSL option is selected. If it is selected, verify that:\n\n\n\nThe Key Store Path points to a valid key store on the application server.\nThe key store referenced in the Key Store Path field contains the proper SSL certificates for the application server itself.\nThe Key Store Password field contains the correct password for the key store that is being referenced.\nAny changes made will require restarting Cascade CMS\n\n\n\nNote: If using the bundled keystore in the Cascade CMS installation, the default password is changeit\n\nIf the SSL option is not selected, skip to Default Java Key Store.\n\nImportant notes on using LDAP over SSL\n\nAny changes made in the LDAP configuration with respect to the key store require a restart of Cascade CMS in order to take effect.\nAny time an LDAP sync occurs, the application will load the key store that is being referenced in the Key Store Path field into memory. Because of this, it is important that you maintain a single key store on your application server that contains any necessary certificates for your environment. Having a single key store with all of the proper certificates in it can prevent issues with different key stores being referenced from different locations within the application environment. Default Java Key Store For those who are either not using LDAP at all (prior to Cascade CMS 8.21) or are not specifying keystore information in the System Preferences (Cascade CMS 8.21+), the application will default to using the key store located within the application's Java installation. To find out which installation of Java the application is using, see this article.\nAfter determining which Java installation is being used, you'll need to make sure that the key store (generally lib/security/cacerts) contains the certificates for the application server itself.",

In most cases, usernames will be all lowercase and they will not contain the domain portion of your email address ('@your-org.com', for example). Reach out to your CMS administrator if you believe you are entering your credentials correctly but are still receiving errors.\nIn most cases, the reason for a user encountering this error will be due to them entering the wrong username (case matters!) and/or password. Assuming these have been ruled out, proceed to the next steps below.\nVerify that the user's account is Enabled\n\nAs an administrator, go into the Administration area and click on the Users link.\nClick on the user account in question.\nConfirm that the \"Enabled\" field is set to \"Yes\".\n\nNote: If you are unable to access the interface (due to a 'Login Failed' error with your own account), you can verify whether or not the account is enabled by executing a database query like the following against your Cascade CMS database:\nselect isEnabled from cxml_user where username = '{username}';\n(making sure to replace {username} with the username in question).\n\nA result of 0 means the account is disabled.\nA result of 1 means the account is enabled.\n\nTo enable a disabled account, execute the following query:\nupdate cxml_user set isEnabled = 1 where username = '{username}';\nIf the user's account is enabled but they still receive the error, continue troubleshooting by following the steps below.\nDetermine how the user is attempting to authenticate\n\nAs an administrator, go into the Administration area and click on the Users link.\nClick on the user account in question.\nCheck the value listed for the \"Authentication\" field. It will be 1 of the 3 types listed below:\n\nNormal - The user's account is managed entirely within Cascade CMS (the username and password are stored locally in the Cascade CMS database). If the user's account is enabled but they still receive a 'Login Failed' message when attempting to log in, an administrator should change the user's password and then provide the user with a new password. At that point, verify that the user is able to log in using the new password provided.\nLDAP - The user's account is managed in your organization's existing LDAP/Active Directory instance. To investigate further, LDAP/AD administrators will want to see if the user account in question has an expired password (in which case a new password must be provided to the user) or if the user has simply entered a bad password (in which case the user may need to be provided with a new password as they may have forgotten the current one). In Active Directory, for example, the status of a user account can be found in the Attribute Editor. Specifically, you can check the badPasswordTime attribute to verify whether or not the user recently entered a bad password.\nCustom - The user's account is managed in your organization's SSO system (CAS, Shibboleth, etc.). Your SSO administrator will need to check for errors related to the user's account from around the time of the failed login attempt(s).\n\n\n\nNote: If you are unable to access the interface (due to a 'Login Failed' error with your own account), the authentication type for a user account can be determined by executing the following database query:\nselect authmode from cxml_user where username = '{username}';\n\n\nA result of 0 means the account is a \"Normal\" account.\nA result of 1 means the account is an \"LDAP\" account.\nA result of 2 means the account is a \"Custom\" account.\n\nStill having trouble?

See the following article for guidelines and tips.\nDetermine where the code snippet should be applied\nBefore getting started, determine how broadly the snippet needs to be applied to your site, as this can help you determine the approach to use.\n\nSite-wide:\n\nConsider using a tag manager (see \"Using a tag manager\" below) to deploy your code site-wide.\nOr apply the code at the Template(s) level so it's inherited by all pages using the Template(s).\n\n\nA subsection of pages in the site:\n\nConsider using a tag manager (see \"Using a tag manager\" below) to deploy the tag if the page's URL matches certain conditions.\nOr apply the code at the Configuration(s) level so it's inherited by all pages using the Configuration(s).\nOr use a Format to render the tag only if the current page matches certain conditions, such as having a specific string in its path.\n\n\nA single page:\n\nApply the code at the individual page level.\nOr embed it in the source code of a WYSIWYG editor on the page (if applicable) if it can go within the body of the page. Use caution with this setup, as the code won't be visible to users working on the visual side of the WYSIWYG editor and it could be unintentionally altered or removed.\n\n\n\nUsing a tag manager\nIf you're already using a tag manager such as Google Tag Manager , or would like to, we'd recommend using this method to deploy code snippets first. Especially if they should apply to your entire site or a large number of pages.\nTag managers have the advantage of not requiring the site to be re-published to update the live site, since it's loaded automatically when a visitor loads a page. This also makes it easier to update and deploy your code snippet in the future.\nUsing the CMS\nIf you choose to maintain and deploy your code snippet with the CMS, before following the guidelines below, be sure to familiarize yourself with the implementation of other links and script tags in your site, as there may already be an appropriate place to add your code snippet.\nFor example, if you have a code snippet that should be added to the head of your page's markup, use More > Show Regions when previewing an example page to see if you already have an XML Block or Format assigned to a Template region within the head that your script could be added to.\nNote - Code snippets, such as JavaScript script tags, often contain invalid XML in their content. To avoid XML validation errors in the CMS, wrap your snippet in a code section.\n\nChoose a protect code section for code that may contain invalid XML.\nChoose a passthrough code section if you only want to the snippet to render in the published page, for example, to avoid tracking activity within the CMS itself.\n\n\n\nCreate an XML Block or Format to house your code snippet.\n\nConsider a Format if you'd like to add conditional statements for when the code snippet should be rendered. For example, if you only want to output the code if the current page is in a specific directory.\nClick Add Content and then choose Block > XML or Format.\nAdd your code snippet to the Block or Format, making sure to wrap it in an appropriate code section (see note above) if needed.\n\n\nCreate a region in your Template(s).\n\nNavigate to your Template and click Edit.\nCreate a new Region in the appropriate area of the markup by adding a System Region tag. Example: <system-region name=\"CHATBOT SCRIPT\"/>\nSubmit your changes.\n\n\nAttach your Block or Format to the Template region.\n\nNavigate to the appropriate Template, Configuration, or Page (see \"Determine where the code snippet should be applied\" above) and click Edit.\nLocate the Regions listing. (For Templates and pages this is on the Configure tab.)\nAssign the Block or Format to the region you created and Submit your changes.",

Using these options, it's possible to instruct search engines as to whether or not they should index particular pages and/or crawl links on those pages.\nTemplate setup\nThe very first step here will be to include a region in your Template where the resulting <meta> tag will be placed in the source code of your page(s).\n\nEdit the Template that your Pages are using\nWithin the <head> tags somewhere, add the following code and save:\n\n<system-region name=\"ROBOTS\"/>\n\nMetadata Set setup\nWe'll add a field to our Metadata Set which will allow for users that edit Pages to select whether or not a Page should be indexed by search engines as well as whether or not links should be analyzed by search engines.\n\nEdit the Metadata Set that your Pages are using\nSwitch to the Custom Fields tab\nClick to add a new Checkbox field\nFill out the following fields with the values seen below:\n\nName: search-engine-options\nField Label: Search engine behavior\nHelp Text: Specify how this page should be treated by search engines in terms of appearing in search results and link crawling\n\n\nUnder the Configuration field, switch to the XML tab\n\nCopy/paste the following XML into that field and click Submit\n\n\n\n<checkbox> <item label=\"Prevent indexing of this page\">noindex</item> <item label=\"Prevent crawling of links in this page\">nofollow</item></checkbox>\nFormat setup\nWith our metadata option set up, we now need to write a Velocity Format which will check to see which (if any) of the options have been selected for a Page and then output the corresponding <meta> tag based on those selections.\n\nCreate a new Velocity Format\nFor the contents of the Format, enter the following code:\n\n#set ($searchEngineOptions = $currentPage.metadata.getDynamicField(\"search-engine-options\"))#set ($robotsContent = $_DisplayTool.list($_ListTool.toList($searchEngineOptions.values), \",\"))#if (!$_PropertyTool.isEmpty($robotsContent))<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"${robotsContent}\"/>#end\nFinal steps\nNow that all of the pieces are in place, the final step of the process is to attach our Velocity Format to the \"ROBOTS\" region that we created in our Template. This assignment can be done at the Template level, the Configuration, or the individual Page level (just depending on which Pages you want to inherit that setup).\nThe most common method is to attach the Format to the region at the Template level (so that all Pages using that Template have the region available as a placeholder for that <meta> tag).\nEnd result\nWhen users go to edit a Page that uses both the Template and Metadata Set as described above, the options will appear as indicated in the screen shot below:\n\nIf no options are selected, no <meta> tag will be added to the Page's source code. If one or both of the options are selected, the tag will be included with the corresponding attribute values. For example, if both options are selected, the output will be:\n<meta content=\"nofollow,noindex\" name=\"robots\"/>\nNotes: \n\nThe sample above is just one of many different ways that you could approach this type of setup. Feel free to modify any of the steps here as needed for your specific use case.\nThe term \"indexing\" in this article is not to be confused with an asset's \"Include when indexing\" option (which is specific to the CMS and has no effect/is unrelated to search engine behavior).",

You can then set the page's link rewriting behavior to Absolute under Edit > Configure > Override the current Site's asset link rewriting behavior for this asset. Add option for alternative canonical URL The example below illustrates how you can set up additional options for pages to output a self-referencing canonical tag or point to another page as the canonical page.\n\nCreate a system-region within the <head> tags of your Template(s). For example:\n<system-region name=\"CANONICAL\" />\n\n\nCreate a Shared Field Group with the following XML:\n<system-data-structure> <group identifier=\"canonical\" label=\"Canonical Settings\" restrict-to-groups=\"Administrators\"> <text field-id=\"eff3e93cc0a8003d49767a63e99b3d5d\" help-text=\"Enable this if the current page is NOT the canonical page, e.g. it's a duplicate.\" identifier=\"canonical-alternate\" label=\"Specify alternate canonical URL?\" required=\"true\" type=\"checkbox\"> <checkbox-item label=\"Yes\" show-fields=\"canonical/canonical-url-type\" value=\"yes\"/> </text> <text field-id=\"eff3e93cc0a8003d49767a63e89422bd\" identifier=\"canonical-url-type\" label=\"Canonical URL Type\" required=\"true\" type=\"radiobutton\"> <radio-item label=\"Choose Page\" show-fields=\"canonical/page\" value=\"page\"/> <radio-item label=\"Enter URL\" show-fields=\"canonical/url\" value=\"url\"/> </text> <asset field-id=\"eff3e93cc0a8003d49767a63755ff381\" help-text=\"Select the canonical page.\" identifier=\"page\" label=\"Choose Page\" type=\"page\"/> <text default=\"https://\" field-id=\"eff3e93cc0a8003d49767a638b0b971b\" help-text=\"Enter the URL for the canonical page.\" identifier=\"url\" label=\"Enter URL\"/> </group></system-data-structure>\n\nAdd this Shared Field Group to the top of one or more of your existing Data Definitions.\n\nCreate a Velocity Format containing the following:\n#set ($canonical = $currentPage.getStructuredDataNode(\"canonical\"))\n\n#if (!$canonical.getChild(\"canonical-alternate\").hasTextValue(\"yes\")) \n ## use current page's URL\n #set ($href = $currentPage.link)\n#else \n ## use alternate canonical page URL\n #if ($canonical.getChild(\"canonical-url-type\").hasTextValue(\"page\"))\n #set ($href = $canonical.getChild(\"page\").asset.link)\n #elseif ($canonical.getChild(\"canonical-url-type\").hasTextValue(\"url\"))\n #set ($href = $canonical.getChild(\"url\").textValue)\n #end\n#end\n\n## output the canonical tag\n<link href=\"${href}\" rel=\"canonical\" />\n\n\nAttach this Format to the CANONICAL system region (at the Template, Configuration, or Page level).\nVisit Manage Site > Site Settings and change your Link Rewriting setting to Absolute.\nEdit one or more pages, configure the additional canonical tag options, and publish the page(s).\n\nNote: When editing a page with this setup, only users in the Administrators group will see these additional options.

    "category": "Faqs",
    "body": "It is possible to publish snippets of HTML which can be pulled in via Server Side Includes (SSI) at runtime on your live web server. This method of including content can be useful for components like navigation menus, footers, and/or any other areas of your site that are commonly used across your site.\nOne drawback of a push CMS (like Cascade CMS) is that if the contents of a navigation menu change, for example, a full site publish is needed in order to ensure that all of the pages on your site get their navigation menu updated accordingly. By utilizing SSI for these areas of your site(s), you can publish a single asset and have all pages on your site load the most up-to-date navigation menu almost instantaneously. \nThe steps below will walk you through a very basic setup that allows you to create/publish a snippet of HTML and then pull that into your pages on the live website through a SSI directive.\nSet up a Page type for \"include\" files\n\nCreate a new Template with the following code:\n\n<!--# cascade-skip--><pass-through> <system-region name=\"DEFAULT\"/></pass-through>\n\nCreate a new Configuration with the following settings:\n\nCheck the Default Output box\nSet the Type of Data field to HTML\nSet the File Extension field to .shtml\nIn the Template field, select the Template that you created in the very first step\nEnsure that the Publishable check box is checked\n\n\nCreate a new Content Type with the following settings:\n\nIn the Configuration field, select the Configuration you created in the step above\nIn the Metadata Set field, select a Metadata Set (the Default will typically be fine in this case)\nIn the Type of Content field, select No Data Definition (WYSIWYG Only)\n\n\n\nAt this point, we can create a Page asset using this Content Type and supply the HTML snippet we're looking to publish to the web server, and then reference the include file we've created using an SSI directive. To do this, follow the steps outlined in the next section below.\nCreate a new \"include\" Page\n\nFrom the Add Content menu, click to create a new XML Block\nIn the content field of the Block, enter the following code and Submit:\n\n<!--# protect-top<ul> <li>Sample item 1</li> <li>Sample item 2</li> <li>Sample item 3</li></ul># protect-top-->\n\nClick the Add Content menu once again and click to create a new Default -> Page\nWhen prompted to select a Content Type for the Page, select the Content Type that you created in the previous section\nGive the Page a name of include-file and then click the Configure tab\nScroll down to the Regions section and in the DEFAULT region, click the Block chooser and select the XML Block that you created above\nSubmit the Page\nPublish the Page to your web server and verify that you can reach it by using the More -> Live option (you should see a mostly empty page with just our unordered list from earlier)\n\nAt this point, we have a Page asset that just contains our short HTML snippet (an unordered list containing 3 list items) and we can now pull it into other pages using an SSI directive.\nAdd the SSI to your page(s)\n\nFrom the Add Content menu, click to create a new XML Block\nIn the content field of the Block, enter the following code and Submit:\n\n[system-view:internal]Enter content here that will be displayed inside the CMS only[/system-view:internal][system-view:external]<!--#include virtual=\"[system-asset]/full/path/to/include-file[/system-asset]\" -->[/system-view:external]\nNotes: - In the code snippet above, we're utilizing system-view tags in order to tell the CMS what should be displayed when previewing inside the CMS versus what should be displayed once published. This is necessary as SSIs will only work when viewing pages on the live website.- In the \"include\" directive, we're surrounding the full path to our \"include\" file with system-asset tags to tell the system that we're linking to an asset that is managed in the system and that it should rewrite the link accordingly on publish.\n\nCreate or edit an existing Page \n\nWhile creating/editing, click the Configure tab\nScroll down to the Regions section, then pick a region where you'd like to attach the HTML snippet we created earlier in this document\nClick the Block chooser in that region and select the XML Block we just created above (the one with the SSI directive in it)\n\n\nPublish the Page and then view it on the live site by clicking More -> Live\n\nAssuming all goes as planned, your published page should display the unordered list that we are including via our SSI.\nAdditional information: The steps above are intended to show how SSIs can be used in conjunction with CMS assets. There are many different ways in which this could be implemented and this document only touches on the general strategy for how it can be done. For example, you'd typically want to attach your SSI directive Block to either a Template region or Configuration region (so that all Pages using that Template/Configuration inherit the SSI directive). It's also very common to have more dynamic content being generated for the HTML snippet using Format logic as opposed to just static HTML in a Block.\nNotes:- The ability to use SSI is dependent on the target web server configuration. You'll want to verify that your web server administrator(s) have this option enabled before you attempt to utilize this strategy.- The HTML includes end up publishing as standard HTML files on the web server. You may wish to exclude the folder/directory where those includes are stored from search engines/crawlers by adding the directory to your robots.txt file on the web server.",

The information below can still be useful for organizations that have not had a chance to upgrade to Cascade CMS 8.15+ yet or that happen to be proxying with Apache, Nginx, etc. (and need to configure the AJP Connector accordingly).\n\nBy default, all versions of Tomcat (which come bundled with Cascade CMS) contain an AJP Connector which is configured to listen on port 8009 across all IP addresses. With the recent discovery of CVE-2020-1938, Hannon Hill recommends taking the following action(s) to ensure that your organization's CMS instance remains secure.\nIf you are using the bundled instance of Tomcat only to run Cascade CMS (not proxying with Apache, Nginx, etc.)\nFor standard installations of Cascade CMS which only rely on Tomcat and are not configured with a proxy server, we recommend taking the following action:\n\nStop Cascade CMS.\nEdit the tomcat/conf/server.xml file.\nLocate the AJP Connector (around lines 116-117).\n\nDisable the AJP Connector by commenting it out. Example:\n <!-- <Connector port=\"8009\" protocol=\"AJP/1.3\" redirectPort=\"8443\" /> -->\n\nStart Cascade CMS.\n\nIf you are using the HTTP Connector to proxy with Apache, Nginx, etc.\nOrganizations using the HTTP Connector (or some other method not using AJP ) to proxy should be sure to disable the AJP Connector using the same steps listed above.\nIf you are using the AJP Connector to proxy with Apache, Nginx, etc.\nFor installations of Cascade CMS where the application is being accessed through a proxy that is configured via AJP, we recommend taking the following action(s):\n\nEnsure that your organization's firewall is configured such that port 8009 (the default AJP port) is not exposed to the internet. Instead, this port should only be accessible to the local machine (if the proxy is on the local machine) or to the IP address of the proxy.\n\nModify the AJP Connector to explicitly listen on a single IP address. This can be done by adding an address attribute to the AJP Connector in the tomcat/conf/server.xml file. Example:\n<Connector port=\"8009\" protocol=\"AJP/1.3\" redirectPort=\"8443\" address=\"127.0.0.1\"/>\n\n\nIn the sample above, the AJP Connector will listen on port 8009 only for the localhost IP of 127.0.0.1 .\nCascade Cloud customers\nOrganizations using Cascade Cloud (hosted by Hannon Hill) are not exposed to this vulnerability.

CVE-2021-4104 does not impact Cascade Cloud as of 3/8/2022 or on-premise Cascade CMS 8.20, because the latest version of Log4j 2.x is in use and is therefore not impacted by this particular vulnerability.\nNote that application logging configuration is not available within the application itself.

We do not make use of the affected JMSAppender in our distribution. That said, if Cascade CMS on-premise logging has been customized in any way, ensure the affected JMSAppender is not being used.\nFurther mitigation\nYou can take the additional step of removing the affected class from the log4j jar file. You'll need to do this for each and every upgrade until another solution exists.\nTo do this:\n\nNavigate to tomcat/webapps within the Cascade CMS home directory\nYou'll need to modify the log4j file not only in the unpacked ROOT directory but also in the bundled ROOT.war if it exists.\nFor the unpacked version:\n\nNavigate to ROOT/WEB-INF/lib\nWith access to the zip tool, you can run:\n$ zip -d log4j-1.2.17.jar org/apache/log4j/net/JMSAppender.class$ deleting: org/apache/log4j/net/JMSAppender.class\nIf you don't have access to zip, you'll need to use something like like the jar or unzip tool to unpack, remove the affected class and repack it.\n\n\nFor the version bundled in the WAR file:\n\nNavigate to ROOT/WEB-INF/lib\nUnpack the WAR file to a temp directory from the webapps directory:\n$ mkdir temp$ cd temp$ jar xzf ../ROOT.war\n\nWith access to the zip tool, you can run: \n$ zip -d WEB-INF/lib/log4j-1.2.17.jar org/apache/log4j/net/JMSAppender.class$ deleting: org/apache/log4j/net/JMSAppender.class\nIf you don't have access to zip, you'll need to use something like like the jar tool to unpack, remove the affected class and repack it.\nRepack the WAR file. From inside the temp directory:\njar cvf ROOT.war *\n\nReplace the older one ensuring that you maintain the original as backup. From webapps:\nrm ROOT.warmv temp/ROOT.war .rm -rf temp\n\n\n\nAlternatively, if you haven't customized the unpacked WAR file, you can delete the entire ROOT directory, skip the first step and make the modifications to the ROOT.war only.\n\nThis vulnerability is a less serious variation of the CVE-2021-44228 which is also mitigated in Cascade CMS.",

This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in a denial of service (DOS) attack. Log4j 2.15.0 restricts JNDI LDAP lookups to localhost by default. Note that previous mitigations involving configuration such as to set the system property log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup to true do NOT mitigate this specific vulnerability. Log4j 2.16.0 fixes this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default. This issue can be mitigated in prior releases (<2.16.0) by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class).\nNational Vulnerability Database Is Cascade CMS affected by CVE-2021-45046 (Log4Shell)? CVE-2021-45046 does not impact Cascade Cloud as of 3/8/2022 or on-premise Cascade CMS 8.20, because the latest version of Log4j 2.x is in use which disables the affected JNDI functionality by default. \nNote that application logging configuration is not available within the application itself. It could only be customized with direct access to the application server.\nOn-premise distributions older than Cascade CMS 8.20\nOn-premise distributions of Cascade CMS are also not impacted by default. We do not make use of the affected JNDI substitution in our distribution. That said, if Cascade CMS on-premise logging has been customized in any way, ensure the affected JNDI substitution is not being used.\nFurther mitigation\nYou can take the additional step of removing the affected class from the log4j jar file. You'll need to do this for each and every upgrade until another solution exists.\nTo do this:\n\nNavigate to tomcat/webapps within the Cascade CMS home directory\nYou'll need to modify the log4j file not only in the unpacked ROOT directory but also in the bundled ROOT.war if it exists.\nFor the unpacked version:\n\nNavigate to ROOT/WEB-INF/lib\nWith access to the zip tool, you can run:\n$ zip -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class$ deleting: org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class\nIf you don't have access to zip, you'll need to use something like like the jar or unzip tool to unpack, remove the affected class and repack it.\n\n\nFor the version bundled in the WAR file:\n\nNavigate to ROOT/WEB-INF/lib\nUnpack the WAR file to a temp directory from the webapps directory:\n$ mkdir temp$ cd temp$ jar xzf ../ROOT.war\n\nWith access to the zip tool, you can run: \n$ zip -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class$ deleting: org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class\nIf you don't have access to zip, you'll need to use something like like the jar tool to unpack, remove the affected class and repack it.\nRepack the WAR file. From inside the temp directory:\njar cvf ROOT.war *\n\nReplace the older one ensuring that you maintain the original as backup. From webapps:\nrm ROOT.warmv temp/ROOT.war .rm -rf temp\n\n\n\nAlternatively, if you haven't customized the unpacked WAR file, you can delete the entire ROOT directory, skip the first step and make the modifications to the ROOT.war only.\n\nOn-premise distributions older than 8.x\nAs was the case for CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046 does not impact on-premise distributions of Cascade CMS older than 8.x because message lookup substitution is not supported in our use of log4j.",

If it does not; however, you will need to publish the asset to one or more Destinations manually.\nIf you don't see the Publish option screen while viewing your asset:\n\nYou may be viewing a Draft of your asset, in which case you'll first need to Submit your changes)\nYour Site Role may not allow for you to publish assets, in which case you'll need to contact your Cascade CMS administrator for assistance.\nYou may be viewing an asset that is not publishable, such as a Block, in which case you'll need to publish assets that are including the asset. For starters, you could check out this article on Publishing Changes to a Block.\n\nVerify that the job has been processed\nThe next step in determining what might be happening with a publish job is to see if it has been processed. When publishing an asset (or assets), the job is sent to the Publish Queue prior to being physically transferred to your web server(s). Your Site Role will determine if you can view the Publish Queue.\nIf your publish job is still in the queue behind other assets waiting to be published, you'll need to wait for those jobs to be processed before your changes will appear on the web server.\nIf you do not have the ability to view the queue, you will need to contact your Cascade CMS administrator to have them check the queue for you or to give you the ability to view the queue yourself.\nIf you don't see your publish job in the Publish Queue, there is a chance it may have been processed already. In the event that a publish job has been processed, it will trigger a publish message that will be sent to your Notifications, at which point, you can see if it resulted in any errors.\nCheck your publish Notifications\nOnce your publish completes, you will receive a Notification containing more information regarding the status of that job. You can view your Notifications by following the steps outlined on this page.\nClicking on the Notification will show you more details including the number of successful jobs, errors, and skipped jobs pertaining to your publish. You'll also be able to see to which Destinations (web servers) your publish job was transmitted.\nIf you've received a publish message showing that there were no successful jobs and no errors...\nVerify that your page has publishable Outputs\nWhile previewing your page, click Details > Design > Content Type to view the page's Content Type.\nUnder Publish Options, ensure that your page Outputs are publishable, and that they are publishable to Destinations in the current site or \"All Destinations\".\nIf you've received a publish message showing that your job was successful, but still don't see the changes on your website...\nVerify that you've published to the correct Destination (web server).\nThe publish message you received in your Notifications will outline to which Destination(s) your files and/or pages were published. Under Successful Jobs, you'll see the Destination listed first for each item that was published. For example:\n[Destination: My Web Server] Main Website: files/images/banner.png\nIf you don't see the Destination listed to which you intended to publish, you'll want to try publishing your asset(s) once again and be sure to select the proper Destination(s). If you don't see the Destination available when you click to publish it, you may not have access to it. In this case, you'll need to contact your Cascade CMS administrator to have them include you in one of the Applicable Groups for that Destination.\nClear your browser cache and/or try a different browser.\nOccasionally, your browser will load a cached version of the page or file that you're attempting to access on your web server(s). To verify whether or not this may be the case, try clearing your browser cache or use a different browser (one you don't normally use) to see if the problem persists.\nIf you've received a successful publish message, cleared your browser cache, tried a different browser, but still don't see the changes on your website...\nCheck the timestamp of the file on the web server's file system.\nUnless you happen to have direct access to the web server, this step will require that you contact your web server administrator for assistance. The goal here is to see if the timestamp (last modified date) of the file in question matches the approximate time when you attempted to publish from Cascade CMS.\nIf the timestamp of the file in question does not match the approximate time of the publish window, the file is either never reaching this web server or it is ending up in a location that you're not expecting (in which case a search of the file system for the name of the file you're publishing may point you to the location of the published file).\nVerify that your Transport/Destination are publishing to the proper location on your web server.\nDepending on your role, this step may require that you contact your Cascade CMS administrator as well as your web server administrator for assistance.\nSee how Transports and Destinations work in conjunction with one another to publish to a particular location on your web server.\nFind out if your web server is caching.\nSome web servers are configured to cache files. You'll need to reach out to your web server administrator to see if the web server in question has this setting enabled. In the event that it does, you may notice that the changes eventually show up (after a particular interval of time). Your web server may also have an option to bypass the server cache by appending certain characters to the target URL (e.g. ?resetcache=1), but your web server administrator should be able to confirm the proper parameters for your organization.\nIf you're still having trouble...\nIn the event that you're still having trouble or you're seeing an error message somewhere that you need assistance with, reach out to our support team here and we'll be happy to help troubleshoot further!",

If the Duration is 00:00, this generally indicates that there is a permissions issue affecting the application's indexes directory. This can be verified by locating the cascade.log file for the day in question and searching for messages like the following:\nERROR [SearchServiceImpl] Could not reset lucene directory, assets will not be added to search index: java.io.IOException: Cannot delete C:\\Program Files\\Cascade CMS\\tomcat\\indexes\\segments.gen\nNote: If messages like the one above are found in the log files, your CMS administrator will need to ensure that the O/S account running Cascade CMS has full privileges to the application's indexes folder on the application server. To find the O/S account that is currently being used for the app, follow the steps outlined here.\n\nIf the task shows as Unfinished, this would indicate that the application may have experienced an ungraceful shutdown during that rebuilding process. If this is the case, follow the steps in this article to begin a new rebuild task.\nNote: Pay special attention to the Duration that you see for previous rebuild tasks so that you have an idea of how long this may take. While search results will begin to populate immediately on rebuild, you may need to wait until the entire job is completed in order to see the results you're expecting.\n\nIf the task shows as Running, wait until it completes and then check once again to see if your search terms return the results that you expect. To get an idea of how long the task may take to complete, look at the Duration of previous tasks for building the search indexes.
